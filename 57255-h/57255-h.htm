<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE.</h2></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> following pages contain a short history of the late Christiana
Treason Trials. During their progress a phonographic report of all
the proceedings was taken and printed, by order of the Court, for the
use of the Judges and Counsel employed in the cause. For this a copy
right was secured, and proposals issued for publishing it in full. Though
more than six months have elapsed, this has not yet been done, and the
only account of the transactions to which the public have access, is contained
in the daily papers of New York and Philadelphia. This
pamphlet has been prepared to supply the deficiency.</p>

<p>The sources of information used in compiling it, have been the phonographic
report already referred to; a transcript of the docket of Alderman
Reigart of Lancaster; a transcript of the docket of E. D. Ingraham,
Esquire, Commissioner of the U. S., resident in Philadelphia; the
records of the Philadelphia County Prison; the records of the Circuit
and District Courts; and the files of the Evening Bulletin. Where
these have not furnished a connected story, the deficiency has been supplied
from the writer&#8217;s own recollection, or that of his friends, who
attended upon or participated in the trial.</p>

<p>Some of the most glaring absurdities and incongruities contained in
Mr. Brent&#8217;s pamphlet, which he calls &#8220;A Report to his Excellency
Governor Lowe in relation to the Christiana Treason Trials,&#8221; have been
pointed out. The very limited circulation of this work, confined, we
believe, to a few who received copies as a personal favor, would render
any notice of it unnecessary, had it not been published in a measure by
the authority of the State, whose imaginary wrongs its author has, by
these means, sought to vindicate. The almost scurrilous terms in which
it denounces the majority of the citizens of Philadelphia, the people of
Pennsylvania, the officers of the Court in which the trials were held, the
Judges who presided, and, in short, every one connected with the case,
except counsel and the witnesses for the prosecution, are conclusive evidence
of more anxiety to emit spleen and mortification, than to subserve
the purposes of truth and justice.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>A popular, not a professional view of the subject has been attempted.
It is amongst the body of the people that false reports have been spread,
and to the people this statement is addressed, in hopes that it may tend
to correct the evil.</p>

<p>In accordance with the wish of the publishers, a brief introduction has
been prefixed, embracing a connected view of all the many attempts
which have been made, at various periods to settle, by Congressional
legislation, the embarrassing question of slavery. The main object is to
show the views entertained upon the subject by the great statesmen who
framed the Constitution, and watched over its first developments; and
accordingly much more space has been devoted to that early legislation,
than to measures which are still fresh in the recollection of those whom
we address. The essay is thought to be appropriate in this connection,
because the late great Compromise, of which these trials are one of the
earliest fruits, is the legitimate consequence of long antecedent measures,
and cannot be fully understood or appreciated without bestowing much
previous study upon our early political history. The sources from which
this introduction has been compiled are strictly original, consisting, as
far as possible, of official or semi-official documents and reports.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SLAVERY AS A NATIONAL QUESTION.</h2></div>


<p>The following brief essay is not intended to be an argumentative
discussion of the subject upon which it treats. Discussions
of that sort have abounded so much of late years, that there
would be much more presumption than wisdom in any attempt
to increase the number. But perhaps it may be matter of
interest, now that the conflict has been going on for more than
sixty years, to know something of its earlier phases, of its
varied successes, and of the deeds done and the words spoken
by those who fought the same battle long ago in the infancy of
the republic. The region of historical research which we are
about to explore, appears to be almost a <i>terra incognita</i> to the
majority of the fiery debaters who now-a-days are prosecuting
this wordy war; or if they occasionally plunge into it for a
moment, it is only to hurry back in premature triumph, dragging
captive some unhappy straggling passage of Jefferson or
Jay, to serve as a bone of contention for a whole generation of
self-constituted agitators in and out of Congress. Now if the
object is merely to perpetuate the agitation, the course pursued
is unquestionably a wise one; for, short as our national history
is, the stock of facts which it supplies us with upon the subject
is assuredly large enough, if used with but a tithe of the economy
heretofore exhibited, to last till the Union and Time itself
shall be no more. But there are some quiet spirits still left who
get weary of this hopeless strife, and who can scarcely afford to
adopt the advice of the Scotch clergyman&mdash;to wait for rest till
they get to heaven; who cannot help calling out, &#8220;Peace, peace,&#8221;
however discordant the answer may be; and who, if they needs
must fight, would be glad to know what they&#8217;re fighting about,
fight in earnest and be done with it. To answer, then, at least
one of these questions, and suggest to this rapidly increasing
class precisely what the present phase of the battle is, and what
hopes there are of final peace, this brief historical sketch is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
attempted. The purpose is not, we repeat it, to discuss the
subject; the author aims not at the dignity of a disputant; he
is more than satisfied with the humbler task of supplying materials
for those who do,&mdash;in hopes that if rage and anger
have hitherto filled the place of armorers in our battle-field,
history may in future discharge the duty a little more creditably.
It is proposed, then, to trace the slavery question at length, so
far as it has been the source of national difficulties, embarrassments
and legislation, with especial reference to its earlier history,
and to the clause in the Constitution respecting fugitives,
which has lately been made the subject of Congressional action.</p>

<p>It will not be necessary to extend our inquiries to any period
anterior to the revolution, or in any way to examine the peculiar
causes which first established and have long perpetuated slavery
amongst us. Prior to that event, it was of course a question
between Great Britain and her colonies, and nice casuistry might
perhaps be needed to determine the relative amount of guilt
chargeable on each of the two parties. The moral value, too, of
a solemn judicial decision, &#8220;that no slave could breathe the air
or stand on the free soil of England,&#8221; may be a little questioned,
when it is remembered that such property would of necessity be
almost worthless in her climate; and that at the very moment
when a reluctant Judge pronounced these boasted words, her
capitalists were rolling in wealth that grew out of the sweat on
negro brows in her American plantations. We have heard of
high bred Southern families in which a thousand out-door slaves
are never suffered to pollute the pure air of the saloons and
chambers that their masters breathe, or tread the rich carpets
that their toil has paid for. The custom is undoubtedly refined
and agreeable, but we never heard that it boasted to rest on
higher grounds than ordinary mortals venture on.</p>

<p>At the time of the declaration of independence, when the
colonies escaped from their long pupilage, and, with new rights
and new responsibilities, set out to act an independent part among
the nations of the earth, the taint of slavery was upon every one
of them; in every one, the soil was tilled by negro bondmen.
The laws regulating the relations between master and slave,
were, it is true, widely different in the different States; in some,
as in Connecticut, the privileges annexed to the condition were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
so wide and the facility of rising from it so great, that the constitutional
euphemism which is now-a-days so boldly metaphorical,
might with every propriety style them &#8220;persons held to
service or labor;&#8221; in others, they were then, as now, a hopelessly
degraded class, whose happiness depended entirely on the arbitrary
will of their masters. Of course it is not intended to
represent that the various States were equally interested in the
institution. Varieties of soil, climate and social habits, had drawn
the great mass of this population to what are now known as the
Southern States. At the time of the Declaration, no authentic
enumeration had been made; but when the first census was
taken in 1791, the total number of slaves in what are now known
as the Northern States, was 40,370; in the Southern, 653,910.
At the earlier period of which we are now speaking, the disproportion
was probably less striking, but sufficiently great to make
the interests of the two sections totally opposite. The difference,
however, did not depend merely upon the amount of capital
invested. The feeling in the North, both moral and political,
was decidedly and in many cases bitterly hostile to slavery. The
most shortsighted, therefore, could not fail to foresee the speedy
adoption of those measures which ultimately provided for general
emancipation. Even in Virginia and Maryland, not then considered
as Southern States, ardent advocates were found to plead
the cause of liberty, and organized action had more than once
been attempted in its behalf. Below the Virginia line, in the
Carolinas and Georgia, an abolitionist was as rare a phenomenon
then as he would be now; those States were yet but thinly
settled, a great part of their lands unreclaimed, and no prospect
of improvement appeared, except in the extensive employment
of slave labor, adapted both to the climate and the character of
the already established settlers.</p>

<p>Such was, briefly, the position of the two parties at the opening
of our independent history; and such it was, also, when the
Federal Convention met at Philadelphia in 1787, to frame the
present Constitution. The question presented itself to this
body in a threefold aspect&mdash;<i>First</i>, as to the influence which an
enslaved race was entitled to exercise in the government; <i>secondly</i>,
as to their further increase by importation; <i>thirdly</i>, as to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
how far Congress and the Constitution were bound to provide
for the security of this sort of property.</p>

<p>The first of these was rightly regarded at the time, as by far
the most important, not only because of the magnitude of the
interests directly involved in its decision, but still more so, because
of the principles which, though scarcely remembered at
present, were undoubtedly the basis of the Compromise, in which
the deliberations of the convention resulted. A moment&#8217;s reference
to the slave census, referred to above, will show how great
was the contrariety of interests involved, and give a tolerably
correct idea of the influences by which the various States were
governed in discussing the subject. For whatever pleasure it
might give us to conceal the humiliating fact, candor will compel
us to acknowledge, that even in those heroic times of our history,
interest seldom gave way to any nobler feeling when a question
like this was to be determined. The original claim set up by
the South but abandoned upon the final vote&mdash;except by South
Carolina, Georgia, and Delaware&mdash;was that the black population
should be as largely represented in Congress, as the white. It
is impossible to give anything but a very brief outline of the arguments
used upon both sides. Without venturing to insist upon
the obvious absurdity, that an enslaved and helpless race were
really entitled to representation because of any rights <i>they</i> themselves
might have to defend or duties which they might be bound
to discharge, the Southern members took the position, not regarded
at that time as utterly heterodox, that a State is entitled
to be represented, not merely because of its containing so many
human beings, but because so many human beings are in reality
only the exponent of so much wealth or so much power contributed
by such State to the support of the general government.
The federal value of the State is in direct proportion to the
amount of this power, and what difference could it make whether
it emanated as in the South from a race called slaves, supported
at the direct expense of their masters, who supplied them liberally
with all the necessaries of life; or as in the North, from a
population occupying precisely the same relative position in the
social scale, performing labor of the same description, maintained,
though in a somewhat different way by the same capitalist,
and called Freeman&mdash;if one were entitled to representation, why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
not the other? The negro population was as essentially a producing
power and as original an element of wealth as any
body of free laborers could be, and therefore as fully entitled to
have their interests consulted in the proceedings of a Government
instituted for the express purpose of providing for the security
of property. But in addition to this, they were entitled to make
this claim not only as producers, but also as consumers of those
foreign productions, the importation of which would form one
great element of wealth in the Eastern States.</p>

<p>The fallacy of this reasoning, specious as it might seem, was
warmly commented on and exposed by the opposite side. If the
Southern slave was to be regarded as any other human being,
and as possessed of those inalienable rights which the Declaration
of Independence proudly claimed for all humanity, why not
at once call him a citizen and give him the right to be represented,
not by his master, but by himself? If he was nothing but
property, why not speak out openly and attempt to make property
the basis of representation, and the Government a tool in
the hands of a moneyed aristocracy? It was conceded that the
slaveholding States were at that time by far the wealthiest part
of the confederacy, but this wealth of slavery was not and could
not be an element of power, but rather of weakness and confusion.
If it was argued that slaves filled, in the South, the same
relative position as free laborers in the North, and their employment
necessarily excluded to a great extent the introduction
of a population which would otherwise be entitled to representation,
then in the same way free and active <i>mind</i>, the only thing
that deserves to be represented, was likewise excluded. But on
a similar principle, the horses, cattle, and even the machinery of
the North, which was nothing but a substitute for so much manual
labor, were equally entitled to be heard on the floor of Congress.
Why should property in one form go to Congress, and be shut
out when it takes another and more human one? &#8220;The houses
in Philadelphia alone,&#8221; said Gouverneur Morris, &#8220;are worth all the
wretched slaves that cover the rice swamps of South Carolina.&#8221;
He ridiculed the idea of treating the Southern slave as a consumer&mdash;&#8220;for
the Bohea tea used by a Northern Freeman will pay
more tax than the whole consumption of the miserable slave,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
which consists of nothing more than his physical subsistence, and
the rag which covers his nakedness.&#8221;</p>

<p>As a last resort, however, the Carolinas had an argument
ready which defied all ingenuity, learning, or statesmanship to
answer, and which has so often proved potential in after discussions.
&#8220;North Carolina would never confederate on any terms
that did not rate the black population at least at three-fifths.&#8221;
Connecticut generosity immediately interposed to prevent so
disastrous a result, and after another fruitless effort to obtain an
equality of representation, as some of the members rather metaphorically
termed it, for the luckless slaves, the clause as it now
stands was adopted by an almost unanimous vote. Thus was
established the second great compromise of the Constitution.
It is in vain to support it now upon the grounds which its friends
originally occupied. Truer views of the real origin and real
ends of Government, have forever exploded amongst us the notion,
that property can in any way with justice be made an element
of representation; and that article in the Constitution
stands now solely upon any merit which it may have acquired as
a necessary concession to reconcile clashing interests; and it
will probably hold its place as long as slavery exists, upon the
simple ground so tersely laid down at the close of the discussion&mdash;that
North Carolina would never have confederated without
it.</p>

<p>The course of the debate had, however, clearly shown that the
slavery question was at best nothing but the stalking horse behind
which deeper influences moved; that though the battle cry
on one side might be the rights of man, and on the other the
rights of the master, yet the battle cry in this, as in many other
cases, hinted but remotely at the real grounds of the war. The
slaveholding States were at that time the richest part of the
Union, but their wealth arose exclusively from agriculture, and
their interests of course centered in this, and in the exportation
of their products. The Eastern and Middle States, though then
comparatively poor, were clearly destined to be the commercial
power of the Union, though the extent of that commerce and
the enormous wealth of which it has been the source, was then
little dreamed of. The great West was as yet a power unknown,
and scarcely foreseen even by the most sagacious statesmen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
The object of the South, therefore, was to increase their productive
power, to give it as great an influence as possible in the
affairs of the country, to leave commerce unfettered, and especially
to exempt exports from the payment of duties. That of the
North, on the other hand, was to give Congress such large powers
in the regulation of commerce, as might be employed in the
protection of their infant marine against foreign competition;
and to diminish the duties on imports. In short it was merely
a question as to which should be the predominating interest&mdash;whether
the South should be a huge plantation to be drained of
its wealth by the merchant princes of the North, or whether the
northern cities should be nothing but the trading depots of
Southern nabobs. The representation of slaves, the chief productive
element of Southern wealth, was selected as the test question,
and the powers of both parties were developed to the utter-most
in debating it. In the end, the North gained the commercial
privileges upon which it had insisted, the South three-fifths
of the anomalous representation which they demanded, together
with the exemption of exports from taxation. The overwhelming
power and wealth which the North have since acquired, and
which must certainly be in some measure attributed to this early
policy, sufficiently proves that they made an excellent &#8220;bargain&#8221;
as one of their members termed it; the <i>morality</i> of the arrangement
we do not propose to discuss, but certainly while that compromise,
be it good or bad, remains in the Constitution, the interested
work of both parties, it would require the nicest casuistry
to determine which of them is entitled to indulge in any special
self-glorification in the premises.</p>

<p>The second question above stated, acquired great additional
importance from the mode in which the first had been determined;
though minor and more local interests prevailed to alter
the arrangement of the contending forces. The whole of the
middle and Eastern States were of course, both from principle
and policy, opposed to the perpetuation of the slave trade. They
had everything to lose and nothing to gain by it. If this population
must needs be represented on the floor of Congress, certainly
their next object was to reduce it to the smallest numbers
possible. But in addition to these very obvious interests, Virginia
and Maryland had other and private reasons for wishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
to abolish a trade which, as their lands were already overloaded
by this unhappy race, could be of no possible service to them,
while to some extent it must deprive them of the ever-extending
southern market, into which their surplus, &#8220;annually arising
and renewing,&#8221; might be profitably disgorged. Virginia philanthropy
was therefore earnest to put an end to so nefarious a
traffic, and its ruinously debilitating and demoralizing effects
were vividly depicted by her talented delegates. South Carolina
and Georgia, whose original swamps were yet unredeemed from
their primeval worthlessness and desolation, and all whose hopes
of future greatness, both political and agricultural, depended on
the increase of this very available population, were sadly dismayed
at the dismal prospect thus suddenly and unfeelingly
opened before them by the desertion of their late allies. In
vain they sought to discover, and no wonder the problem puzzled
them, why it should be a damning crime to buy prisoners of war
on the banks of the Niger, but a very laudable and eminently
patriotic course to buy black children and mulattoes bred for
the purpose on the banks of the Potomac.</p>

<p>We would not, however, represent that this question was debated
by all the Northern members with such exclusively interested
views as marked their treatment of the preceding one.
Many of them were really alive to the horrors of a trade which
the whole civilized world was beginning to look upon with detestation,
and they protested vehemently against its toleration
under a new and republican government. But South Carolina
was by this time thoroughly versed in that omnipotent logic which
has tied up so many Gordian knots from that time to this. &#8220;Religion
and humanity,&#8221; said Rutledge, &#8220;have nothing to do with
the question. Interest alone is the governing principle with
nations. The true question at present is, whether the Southern
States shall or shall not be parties to the Union.&#8221; &#8220;South
Carolina,&#8221; said Cotesworth Pinckney, &#8220;can never receive the
plan if it prohibits the slave trade;&#8221; and &#8220;Georgia,&#8221; echoed
Baldwin, &#8220;will never become a member of the Union, if forbidden
to import slaves.&#8221; Ellsworth, from Connecticut, forthwith
took the alarm&mdash;&#8220;was afraid of losing two States, while such
others as might be disposed to stand aloof, would fly into a variety
of shapes and directions, and most probably into several confederacies,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
not without bloodshed.&#8221; This singular imaginary spectacle
of States <i>flying into a variety of shapes</i>, which has rambled
through the brains of successive generations, till the genius of
the last great compromiser exalted it into the sublime metaphor
of erratic planets rushing madly from their spheres, of course
settled the question at once, and the slave trade was tolerated
till 1808, under the harmless euphemism of the migration and
importation of such persons as any of the then existing States
might think proper to admit.</p>

<p>Whether the controversial resources of the Convention were by
this time exhausted, or whether revolutionary sagacity failed to
discover any new danger to the Union in a clause that in more
modern times has proved a mine of most combustible perils; or
whether, as is most likely, the members saw that the political interests
of the two great sections were in no way staked upon the decision;
certain it is, that when, late in the summer, Mr. Butler suggested
the restoration of fugitives from labor as an amendment to
the article providing for the delivering up of criminals, the only
objection offered was that the two clauses seemed somewhat incongruous.
The proposal was withdrawn for the moment and submitted
a few days afterwards by the same gentleman and C.
Pinckney. It was at once agreed to without debate. It is somewhat
singular that so many complaints should have been made of
the inadequacy of a provision thus expressly fashioned by the
party it was intended to benefit, and which is in reality more
stringent than the one which, had it not been for the Northern
members, would originally have been adopted.</p>

<p>The Convention adjourned about the middle of September, and
the members betook themselves to their respective homes&mdash;most
of them to defend in their State conventions the great work
which they had completed. It would be a tedious, and is happily
an unnecessary task, to trace the Constitution through the many
ordeals it had to pass, ere a final ratification was obtained. The
arguments used both by the friends and opponents of the compromises,
were the same as those already sketched. Suffice it to
say that while the toleration of the slave trade and the apportionment
of representatives, met with serious opposition in all
the Northern States; yet so far as there are any reports of the
debates, there does not appear to have been a word said either<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
for or against the clause relating to the restoration of fugitives,
except in Virginia and the two Carolinas, where it was enumerated
among the victories gained for the <i>South</i>, and spoken of
in terms of high approval. Generally, however, it was passed
over without the slightest comment.</p>

<p>Such, then, were, upon this subject, the materials of controversy
bequeathed to posterity by the framers of the Constitution&mdash;harmless
enough, it would seem, and not easily tortured out of
their quiescent state; but in the gradual change of times and
parties, and magnified, too, by sectional interests and passions,
found amply sufficient for the political wranglers of three generations,
and gifted with a vitality and obstinacy that survive
unchanged the conflicts of sixty years&mdash;neither broken by the
blows nor mollified by the compromising caresses of whole hosts
of eloquent statesmen.</p>

<p>The jubilee that hailed the birth of the new government was
scarcely over, ere its friends, in their eagerness to push the advantages
already gained, and its enemies, in the hope of retrieving
their defeat, found means to rouse into new life the scarce
quieted troubles of the Convention. The relative importance,
however, of the slavery questions, was already beginning to
change. The provision apportioning representatives and direct
taxes, was so carefully worded and had been so anxiously debated
both in the Federal and State Conventions, that no flaw could be
found to hang a doubtful construction on, and little hope could
be entertained of overturning that which had been so deliberately
and so recently agreed upon as in some measure the corner-stone
of the structure upon which all the nation&#8217;s hopes depended. It
was rather the toleration of the slave trade which at this early
period stung the consciences or clashed with the interests of a
portion of the members. In the first session of the first Congress,
when the tariff bill was under discussion, Parker, a delegate
from <i>Virginia</i>, first rekindled the wordy war, by moving to
insert a clause imposing a duty of ten dollars a head, which was
allowed by the Constitution, upon every slave imported. The
question seems to have been debated, like its countless progeny,
with abundant warmth. Mr. Smith, of South Carolina, informed
the House that &#8220;no topic had yet been introduced so important
to South Carolina and the welfare of the Union.&#8221; Jackson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
from Georgia, one of the most indefatigable debaters of his day,
and a man of very considerable abilities, attacked Virginia with
especial bitterness for her interested and hypocritical philanthropy.
But perhaps the most remarkable, as it certainly was
the most able speech delivered on the subject, was that of Madison
in support of the measure. As his opinions are known to
have coincided with those of Washington, Jefferson, and Patrick
Henry, they may be fairly taken as expounding the sense of
Revolutionary Virginia on the great interests of slavery. &#8220;By
expressing,&#8221; said he, &#8220;a national disapprobation of that trade, it
is to be hoped we may destroy it, and so save ourselves from
reproaches, <i>and our posterity from the imbecility ever attendant
upon a country filled with slaves</i>. This is as much the interest
of South Carolina and Georgia as of any other States. Every
addition they receive to the number of their slaves tends to
weakness, and renders them incapable of self-defence. In case
of hostilities with foreign nations, their slave population will be
the means, not of repelling invasion, but of inviting attack. It
is the duty of the general government to protect every part of
the Union against danger as well internal as external. Everything,
therefore, which tends to increase this danger, is a proper
subject for the consideration of those charged with the general
administration of the government.&#8221; Parker finally withdrew
his motion, intending, however, to make it the subject of a separate
bill. The chief reason assigned for this course was, the
unwillingness of many of the members to vote for a clause by
which they might seem, however indirectly, to sanction the idea
that human beings were to be treated like goods and chattels,
and to be classed with and legislated upon as such.</p>

<p>No member, however, was found disposed to moot the question
so late in the session, and it slept quietly till March of the following
year, when it presented itself in a new and much more troublesome
form. The interests of humanity involved in the abolition
of slavery, had not been left altogether to the mercy of politicians
and political expediency. At a much earlier period, philanthropic
and religious organizations had been established with
a view to expedite a result so consonant with the aims of humanity
and justice. Among these, the Society of Friends had
especially distinguished itself, and some of its more active members<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
now resolved to seize the fortunate occasion, offered by the
establishment of a new and vigorous government, to direct, if
possible, some of its wholesome energies to the attainment of
their great object. The Yearly Meetings of Pennsylvania and
Delaware, accordingly united in a petition, praying Congress to
abolish the slave trade. The phraseology of the petition was a
little ambiguous, making it doubtful whether it really prayed an
immediate abolition, or only that Congress should use whatever
power they might possess under the Constitution, to discourage
the hateful traffic. Viewed in the latter light, the prayer was
undoubtedly a most proper one; and even if the former be its true
construction, the petitioners only shared an error common to some
of the first statesmen of the day&mdash;that of over estimating the
powers of a newly constituted and untried government. But
whatever was its true meaning, the petition broke like a thunderbolt
over the heads of the irritable congressmen. The debate
exceeded in violence anything that had yet been heard. The
Quakers who had ventured to appear in the gallery to countenance
their unlucky petition, were encountered with scoffing and
personal abuse. Jackson renewed his former threats; the hall
rang with cries of dissolution; falling columns, torn flags, blood-stained
battle fields, and all the dread imagery that seems to be
stereotyped in some imperishable material, was paraded with
frightful significancy before the startled audience. On the following
day, however, to which the debate had been adjourned,
the Friends appeared with a formidable auxiliary indeed. Next
to Washington, no man was regarded in those days with more
general veneration, than the sage and statesman, Franklin. As
early as 1787, this great and good man had been chosen first
President of a &#8220;Society for promoting the abolition of slavery,
for the relief of free negroes unlawfully held in bondage, and for
improving the condition of the African race&#8221;&mdash;a society which
deserves especial mention here, as one of the latest acts of its
useful and honorable career, has been to support the defence
in the Treason trials, to a history of which this brief essay is intended
as a preface. A petition of the same nature, as that of
the Yearly Meetings, was presented from this Society and signed
by Franklin&mdash;this being perhaps the last official act of a strangely
varied life, in the whole course of which it would be difficult to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
point out a single step taken unadvisedly, or a word uttered
which the speaker would afterwards have wished to retract. After
a long recital, the memorial concluded, by praying &#8220;that Congress
would promote mercy and justice towards this distressed
race; and step to the very verge of the power vested in them,
for discouraging every species of traffic in the persons of our
fellow men.&#8221;</p>

<p>It would be difficult for any but a congressman, looking at
this paper now, to find in it the materials for excited debate, or,
at any rate, for violent invectives against the impertinence of its
framers. It certainly does not arrogate the privilege of judging
or even suggesting the course which it behoved Congress to take.
With mingled modesty and confidence, it is left to more deliberate
counsels to determine what may be and what ought to be
done, the petitioners only imploring, for the sake of humanity,
religion, and consistency, that all which could be done, should be
done. If such was the spirit that offered it, that which received
it was widely different. The debate of the previous day was renewed
with additional violence&mdash;policy, interest, the Constitution,
the Declaration of Independence, history, antiquity, justice,
religion, and the Bible, were as usual confidently invoked to the
support of both sides. The house was divided much in the same
way as the Convention had been on the same subject. But the
debate is entitled to particular notice, as opening for the first
time the constitutional question which for many years agitated
both houses, as to how far Congress could be considered as true
to its duty in refusing to listen to and to commit any memorial
whatever, not flatly absurd and extravagant&mdash;no matter how certain
might be the fate which in committee it was doomed to meet.
The negative was earnestly insisted upon by Madison and Paige
from Virginia, and the petition was finally committed by a vote
of forty-three to eleven. After a month&#8217;s deliberation the committee
produced an elaborate report, submitting that Congress
had no power to abolish the slave trade till 1808, though they
might regulate the manner in which it was conducted, and impose
the tax of ten dollars if they saw fit; that they had no
power to emancipate the slaves already held in the various States,
nor to interfere with the domestic legislation by which the several
State legislatures might see fit to govern or educate this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
species of property; but that they had the power to prohibit
citizens of the United States from supplying foreign countries
with slaves, and to forbid foreigners fitting out slave ships in our
ports; and finally that they would exercise all the authority they
had to promote the views presented by the memorialists.</p>

<p>Our limits will not permit us to give even an abstract of the
arguments, thinly scattered through six days of congressional
declamation, upon this memorable report. The speakers readily
divided themselves into the three parties which have ever since
been maintained, whenever a similar question has arisen in
either house&mdash;the earnest and uncompromising opponents of
slavery; its equally zealous defenders; and a third party, which
from that day to this has uniformly stood between the two, with
temporising, soothing, and compromising measures, promising
peace, but sowing the seeds of future war, quieting the temper
but not satisfying the understanding, sweet to the mouth but
bitter to the belly. Jackson and Smith, after deprecating the
question altogether as unconstitutional and uncalled for, finally
took bolder ground than any they had yet assumed, insisting on
the justice and necessity of their favorite institution; on the
happy condition of the Southern slave, as compared with the
laborers of Europe, and the lower classes of the North; that
slavery, sanctioned by the example of every illustrious nation of
ancient and modern times, looked for its original to the will of
God himself; that this unnecessary measure bade fair to plunge
the Union into confusion; that the South was prepared to
defend, and would defend their property against every aggression;
that if the compromises of the Constitution were not to be
respected, the Union, which had been cemented by them must
at once and forever be dissolved.</p>

<p>The opposite side was supported mainly by Virginia, Delaware,
and Pennsylvania; but the only speech of interest on their side,
was that of Scott, from the last named State, who labored, with
no little ingenuity, to prove that Congress were in no wise bound
to inactivity by the clause in question; that, as the arbiters of
commerce, the framers of naturalization laws, and the punishers
of piracy, they could in many ways not only control, but if they
saw fit, at once abolish the traffic, in spite of this ambiguous and
disgraceful restriction.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>There was not, and there could not be, anything original in
the views of the third party, except perhaps that their most
earnest advocate, Baldwin, came from Georgia.</p>

<p>This famous debate, the parent of a countless offspring,
resulted in a compromise, recommended as &#8220;the most conciliatory,
and the best adapted to the present situation of things.&#8221;
It consisted in carefully striking out of the report every clause
to which any body could frame a serious objection, and entering
the rest on the Journal without taking any final action on it.
The report as entered, asserted the power of Congress to regulate
the slave-trade, so far as to secure the humane treatment of
the slaves during their passage, to prohibit foreigners from
fitting out slave ships in our ports, and our citizens from supplying
foreign States with this commodity; but disclaiming all
right to interfere further before 1808, or to exercise any authority
in the emancipation of slaves already in bondage, or in the
amelioration of their condition. No intimation was made as to
how they might choose to exercise the powers thus claimed. The
influence which this result has had upon all after times, singularly
confirms a prediction made by Scott, in the course of the
speech already referred to&mdash;&#8220;that what was said, and more particularly
what was done in Congress, at that time, would in some
degree form the political character of America on the subject of
slavery.&#8221; In fact, congressional legislation has never departed
from the standard here established. All attempts to make this
really a national question, have been uniformly employed for the
mere purposes of temporary agitation, and have as uniformly
ended in a compromise between a doubting majority and a resolute
and unflinching minority.</p>

<p>A question of much more practical importance at the present
day, and on which it would be extremely interesting to know the
views expressed by the sages who watched over the infancy of
the Republic, must have arisen in the House shortly afterwards.
North Carolina had ceded a portion of her enormous but unsettled
territory to the General Government, on the express condition,
however, that Congress should do nothing towards emancipating
the slaves already to be found there. No report, however,
of the debate upon the bill has been preserved.</p>

<p>For some time after this, all agitation of the subject was carefully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
avoided. Petitions were occasionally received from Abolition
Societies in New York and Pennsylvania, praying Congress
to put to some practical use the powers which, by the report
entered on the Journal of the House, they had declared themselves
possessed of. Some were referred to committees which
never reported, others suffered to sleep quietly on the table of
the House, and one from Warner Mifflin, a well-known Delaware
Friend, escaped the obscurity in which its fellows were forgotten,
only to be returned to him with an abusive speech from North
Carolina, which nobody thought it worth while to answer.</p>

<p>But, during the second session of the Second Congress, the
highly important act was quietly passed, which from that time till
1850 regulated the return of fugitives from justice and labor.
The Governor of Virginia, acting under the advice of counsel,
had refused to deliver up a fugitive criminal to the Executive of
Pennsylvania, conceiving that the provision in the Constitution
did not sufficiently define the manner in which this duty was to
be complied with. The matter had been submitted to President
Washington, who made it the subject of a special message to the
Senate, whereupon an Act providing for the practical enforcement
of both Constitutional provisions, was shortly after proposed
and passed. With regard to fugitives from labor, it
enacted that the owner, or his agent, might seize such fugitive,
take him before a United States Judge, or any magistrate of the
city, town, or county, where the arrest was made, prove to his
satisfaction, by evidence written or oral, that the claim was a
just one, and, having obtained his certificate to that effect, carry
him back as his slave, without any further proceedings whatever.</p>

<p>The Bill became a law, with little or no opposition in either
House, attracting scarce any public attention either in the North
or South.</p>

<p>From this time till the year 1807, the history of the subject
may be very briefly summed up. Petitions were from time to
time received, complaining of the hardships suffered by emancipated
negroes in some of the southern States, and praying the
interference of Congress to mitigate the horrors of the slave
trade. They gave birth to the usual amount of declamation,
were in some cases referred to committees, in others either rejected,
censured, or suffered to sleep on the table. The two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
parties of Federalists and Democrats, into which the nation was
divided had long before this, become distinctly marked, every
question which was broached assumed more and more a political
aspect, and as the power of the Federalists hurried to its fall, the
tendency grew constantly stronger in both, to make almost any
sacrifice or concession, to win over southern votes. Hence the
triumphs of the friends of emancipation were pretty evenly
balanced by their losses. Slavery was rapidly disappearing
from the northern States and the attempt repeatedly made to
introduce it into the territory of Indiana, was as often defeated.
But on the other hand South Carolina, after a long interval,
again opened her ports to African slavers, and all attempts
failed to impose the Constitutional tax upon the importation;
while the purchase of Louisiana and the organization of Mississippi,
gave additional strength to the South, though the danger
of flooding them with slaves through the open ports of South
Carolina was in some measure obviated by a special provision
which closed these newly acquired territories against any of the
recent arrivals.</p>

<p>The long wished for time at length arrived when Congress
might constitutionally abolish the slave trade, when the third
compromise of the Federal Convention was at length to expire,
and the most glaring contradiction in our history was to exist
for the future only as a recollection of the past, not as a present
and pressing disgrace. All parties were alike resolved to seize
the happy occasion. Even South Carolina for a while did not
venture to disturb the general unanimity, and resigned herself
quietly to her fate. But as the course of Congressional legislation
never yet ran smoothly, so here a singular notion was started
in Committee by which it was proposed to prohibit the traffic by
heavy penalties, and yet at the same time to enrich the National
treasury by its proceeds. This extraordinary plan proposed, in
short, that all slaves captured in our vessels by the United States
cruisers, should be forfeited and sold by the United States into
perpetual slavery. Yet a plan so preposterous as this, by which
the National Government was to be deeply implicated in a crime
which it was the very object of the law to prevent, was triumphantly
carried by the violence of the southern members through
every stage of legislation to the very verge of final passage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Happily for the honor of the country the North was at last aroused
from her lethargy, and by a desperate effort obtained a recommitment
of the bill even at this latest possible moment; the
obnoxious clause was altered into a binding out to service for a
term of years in the free States, and the bill came up for final
action. What possible objection could be taken to a provision
which threw almost the whole burthen on the free States, it is
hard indeed to discover; but the idea of emancipating an African,
no matter under what circumstances, was altogether too much
for the equanimity of southern blood. Their members, as
Ellsworth would have expressed it, &#8220;immediately flew off into a
variety of shapes,&#8221; protesting that they would sacrifice their lives
rather than submit to it, and that military force should in vain
attempt to force it on them. This meaningless declamation was
persisted in on the following day upon some minor parts of the
Bill providing for the transportation of slaves by coasting vessels,
requiring <i>manifests</i> certified by proper officers in order to prevent
the obvious danger of deception being practised in this way upon
the general Government. The most audacious threats were
freely uttered. Randolph, the eccentric member from Virginia,
took the lead, gave his singular genius for virulent abuse full
scope, and at last concluded by hoping that if the Bill were
signed by the President in its present form, not a single southern
member would be seen on the floor of the next Congress. The
bill was nevertheless signed as it passed, the southern members
came back punctually at the opening of the next session, and
have with praiseworthy regularity been drawing their eight dollars
per day from the National Treasury from that time to this.</p>

<p>With the passage of this great measure the victories of the
abolitionists reached their climax. From 1807 up to 1818 their
successes were fairly balanced by their reverses. The great acquisitions
of new territory during this period were so many
triumphs for the South, and the new free States which came into
existence were erected in districts into which the slave system had
never ventured. The spirit which had supported the friends of humanity
in their labors seemed to be gradually decaying. The representatives
of free principles in the southern States grew yearly
less numerous, while an unaccountable apathy was creeping over
the once vigorous and energetic societies of the North. Politicians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
took less and less interest in views which, if openly professed,
would rob them of many friends, while candidates for National
offices took refuge from such dangerous ground in discreet silence
or studied ambiguity. Without spending time, therefore, upon the
many less important debates that intervened between this and
the year 1819 we may pass at once to the memorable one which
in that and the following year, threw the whole nation into a
state of unparalleled excitement. A few remarks will serve to
explain the origin of this new form of the question. In 1787,
before the adoption of the Constitution, the old Congress had, by
a <i>unanimous</i> vote, passed their famous ordinance for the government
of the territories of the United States. Among the fundamental
conditions of this compact, as it was called, and which
was &#8220;forever to remain unalterable,&#8221; except by the mutual consent
of both the contracting parties, was an article providing for the
perpetual exclusion of slavery from this &#8220;virgin soil.&#8221; The
honor of introducing the provision has been since disputed between
Virginia and Massachusetts; but be that as it may, its adoption
seems to have been a natural effusion from the spirit of freedom
which warmed every heart in those days from New Hampshire
to Georgia. The subsequent cessions of territory by Georgia
and North Carolina, out of which the States of Mississippi and
Tennessee were erected, had, however, been guarded by express
reservations of the rights of slaveholders, and these reservations
were, as we have seen, necessarily respected by Congress. But
upon the purchase of Louisiana and Missouri from France in
1803, no such stipulations had been introduced into the Treaty;
yet while Congress does not seem to have thought itself at liberty
to interfere with the already vested rights of slaveholders in those
territories, every possible measure was adopted to prevent the
further increase of the race by migration or importation from
abroad. Louisiana was admitted almost immediately, passing
with scarce any transition from her condition as a French colony
to that of an independent American State. With regard to her,
therefore, it was thought inexpedient to startle these recently acquired
and scarce reconciled citizens, by legislation which they
might misconstrue into arbitrary misgovernment taking advantage
of their helplessness. In 1802, 1816 and 1818, Ohio, Indiana
and Illinois had been successively and quietly admitted under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
the terms of the ordinance of &#8217;87. The country was thus in a
state of perfect repose so far as this question was concerned. All
early excitement had died away, a new generation had arisen in
Congress, and new intellects were roaming about seeking the
material for agitation and display. At this juncture Missouri
applied for admission to the Union. A large majority of the
Northern members at once decided that they would in all future
legislation bind themselves irrevocably to the free principles of
the ordinance of &#8217;87. Missouri, it was true, had at the time a
large number of slaves within her borders, but upon these vested
rights as the South was pleased to call them, the North did not
propose to encroach. But they contended, that up to the last
moment of her territorial existence the paramount authority of
Congress over her could not be questioned. The Constitution in
providing that &#8220;new States may be admitted into the Union,&#8221;
must have intended to allow Congress to exercise some discretionary
power in the case, and how could such power possibly be
exercised if not by imposing conditions upon the high privilege
they were bestowing. Was it to be in the power of any community,
no matter how barbarous their laws or how monstrous their
social habits, to claim admission into a Union already the hope
and admiration of the world, simply upon showing that they
numbered the requisite population and had set up a Government
which they might choose to call republican? Such a doctrine
could never be tolerated in a civilized and Christian society, and
never had been acquiesced in heretofore by the general Government.
Not a single State had yet been admitted, except upon
some conditions or restrictions. And if the general principle
were once allowed that the power to impose such restrictions
existed, could a case be imagined more urgently demanding its
exercise? Were Congress to be called upon at this late day to roll
back the tide of legislation which ever since the &#8220;immortal ordinance
of &#8217;87&#8221; had been flowing on towards the fulfillment of those
bright visions of universal freedom and equality in which the
fathers of the revolution had indulged? Could it be, that the
southern members, who had uniformly mourned over slavery as
the greatest of evils, and had proclaimed again and again that it
was a heavy hereditary curse of which their constituents longed
to free themselves, could it be that these very statesmen were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
seeking to extend this curse, to perpetuate this evil, and fasten
upon the growing west an Institution that Washington, Madison
and Jefferson had denounced as demoralizing and debilitating?</p>

<p>On the other side, it was argued that the Ordinance of &#8217;87
was never intended by its framers to apply to any other territory
than that which was actually in the possession of the United
States at the time of its passage; that the established habits of
the region which was now to be admitted, peremptorily called for
the toleration of slavery; that the Constitution did not, and no
power could restrain a sovereign State from establishing slavery,
or any other institution she chose, in her midst; that any proviso
like this, therefore, pretending to control that sovereignty,
was an absurdity; that Congress had no power to legislate, except
for territories, and by the very act into which this proviso
was sought to be introduced, Missouri would cease to be a territory,
and claim equal powers with those who now presumed to
dictate to her; that as well might the South seek to impose
slavery upon Michigan and the uninhabited forests bordering on
the great lakes. As to the inhumanity of extending what was
acknowledged to be an evil and a curse, it must be remembered
that the narrower the boundaries into which slavery was
crowded, the more terrible these evils became, and that it was
only by widely diffusing it that a hope could be entertained of
ameliorating, and perhaps eradicating them. Of course, the usual
hints about dissolution, anarchy, and bloodshed, accompanied
these arguments. But the question did not confine itself to
Congress. The excitement spread rapidly both North and South.
The daily press teemed with the proceedings of public meetings,
with private remonstrances, and with legislative resolutions. The
future condition of an enormous territory, stretching far into the
distant West, was supposed to be at stake. No means were
spared to rouse the public feeling to the highest possible pitch;
dissolution and civil war, with all their ghastly paraphernalia,
were paraded before the people through every possible medium;
and when, at last, the session closed, and the question still remained
unsettled, there were few hearts firm enough to look with
untroubled equanimity upon the rapidly gathering storm.</p>

<p>The debate of the following session was still more violent.
The wide-spread popular excitement urged on the Representatives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
of every section to express, in the angriest terms, the feelings of
their constituents. The Senate had repeatedly negatived the
restricting proviso, as it was called, and the House as often insisted
upon inserting it. At this juncture, Maine applied for
admission as a separate and independent State; and as no possible
objection could be urged against her, a bill for the purpose
passed rapidly through the House, and was sent to the Senate.
This happy opportunity for forcing the House into a Compromise
was eagerly seized, and an attempt made to saddle the bill
with an extraordinary series of amendments providing for the
unconditional admission of Missouri. The opponents of slavery
in the Senate, though a minority, were, however, a most determined
one. But in vain they represented the absurdity of calling
this a Compromise, merely because two utterly incongruous
measures were strangely crowded into a wholesale bill; and
equally in vain, when a separation of the unnatural Union was
denied them, did they, for more than a month of anxious debating,
struggle to hang their favorite proviso to this already many-tailed
monster. The bill, with its amendments, was sent back
to the House; but the Representatives had been as busy as their
neighbors, and having, by this time, nearly completed a bill of
their own on the Missouri claims, the monster of the Senate&#8217;s
creation was, with little ceremony, stripped of all his tails, and
sent back again to that august body in his original simplicity.
The crisis was now approaching with a vengeance. In vain the
bill was tossed back and forward, from House to House; the
fourth of March was rapidly approaching, and owing to her
peculiar relations to Massachusetts, the fourth of March was the
last day upon which Maine could hope for an independent existence.
Rumors of secession grew louder and louder, as the hope
of an adjustment grew hourly fainter. The people were wound
up to the highest pitch of excitement; all other objects were forgotten
in the one absorbing question that agitated every heart;
and on the morning of the second of March, an earthquake
might almost have rolled away unheeded, as at the battle of
Thrasymene. All sides began to be seriously alarmed at the
possible consequences of their temerity&mdash;the majority yielded,
as usual; in a few short hours the great Missouri Compromise
was passed, the storm died away, the breakers were cleared, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
Union was saved, and the newspapers said that everybody was
overjoyed at the happy adjustment. Whether the slaves in
Missouri joined in the general jubilee and offered up their thanksgivings
for the salvation of the country, does not distinctly appear&mdash;possibly,
because the slaves of Missouri were not in the
habit of expressing their opinions, or offering their worship
through the convenient medium of the public press. In substance,
the Compromise admitted the new state without the restricting
proviso, and prohibited slavery forever in the rest of the
purchased territory north of 36 30.</p>

<p>For nearly a year, the Union slept in peace, earnestly trying
to flatter itself into the conviction, that the &#8220;distracting question&#8221;
was at last put to rest, and obstinately oblivious of an
ancient law enacted by Providence long before the foundations
of the Union or the earth, either, were laid; and, wherein, it is
provided, that of two opposing principles, one must be right, and
the other wrong, that no compromise between them, however
unanimously voted, can, in the nature of things, be permanent;
and that in spite of enthusiastic conventions and full-mouthed
Congresses, said compromises will forever tend to change, to
decay, and to self-destruction. The operation of this most impracticable
law, as modern politicians would term it, suddenly
and most disagreeably startled the Union from its comfortable
nap. Missouri, after discovering so cheap a path to celebrity,
was not disposed to abandon it without further efforts to distinguish
her infant name. It was still necessary for her, ere she
could take her place in the happy and united family of American
States, to frame for herself a Constitution, and present it for
the approval of Congress. In this, she made it the duty of her
future Legislature to &#8220;pass such laws as were necessary to
prevent free negroes and mulattoes from coming to and settling
in the State, under any pretext whatever.&#8221;</p>

<p>The constitutionality of this provision, which has since been
adopted by several of the Southern States, has never been
judicially determined. The clause with which it is thought to
conflict, is that which provides, that &#8220;the citizens of each State
shall be entitled to all the privileges and immunities of citizens
in the several States.&#8221; Now, if residence and the right to be
protected in acquiring and transmitting property under the laws<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
be sufficient to constitute citizenship, the free negro population
of every Northern State would be entitled to some privileges in
the State of Missouri; and, assuredly, when a party is entitled
to exercise certain rights within a given territory, it can never
be legal to deprive him of those rights, by forbidding him to enter
it. And even if these qualifications are insufficient to constitute
citizenship, (a theory which would exclude a large proportion of
the white population in some of the Southern States,) yet in a
few of the free States the right of voting is at present added to
them; and in these cases, at least, if the clause be not doomed
to remain forever a dead letter, it would seem to find its application.
On the other hand, it was urged with great force, that
if the Legislature of a State esteem a certain class of population
dangerous to its existence, it must be entitled by the first principle
of self-preservation&mdash;the foundation both of national and
individual existence&mdash;to exclude them from its midst. The clause
in the Constitution cannot mean that every citizen of each State
is entitled to become such in every other State. This is notoriously
untrue. In some States freehold qualifications are required
for voters; in others not. In some there are restraints upon the
acquisition of property, which in others do not exist. Where,
then, is the line to be drawn between constitutional and unconstitutional
differences? Each State may determine the qualifications
necessary for its voters&mdash;why may not one of them be a
peculiar color? Each State may exclude from its borders the
professors of particular occupations, which may be distasteful to
it, or which it may fancy to be dangerous; why not those who
have, at any time, exercised such occupations&mdash;which would
amount to the same thing as the exclusion of an obnoxious race?</p>

<p>During a long and troubled session, this intricate question was
argued both by Congress and the people, with a violence unknown
before. Mr. Clay, for a long time, struggled in vain to close
the rapidly widening breach. In vain, his famous Committee
of Thirteen reported a series of compromising resolutions; both
sides were too far advanced to retract, and the platform was
angrily rejected. No question, however insignificant, could be
taken up, into which these bitter feelings were not dragged; the
business of the Nation was wholly suspended, while the contending
forces hurled harangues of defiance at each others&#8217; heads, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
were re-echoed with equal fury from every village in the country.
A settlement grew more and more hopeless; and, at last, a formal
plan of secession was agreed upon by a minority of the
State. The cry of &#8220;<i>Danger to the Union</i>&#8221; has become so hackneyed
of late years, as to be treated with contempt by rational
men of all parties; but, if ever it had a serious and alarming
meaning, it was at the time we are speaking of. Even President
making and President greeting, failed to drown the dismal
foreboding, that soon all Presidents might be memories of the
past. A storm was raised that no one had power to quell; &#8220;the
spirits had come from the vasty deep,&#8221; and no magician was found
who could charm them back again. At length, by slow and
cautious advances, Mr. Clay again approached the troubled circle;
increased his Committee to twenty-three, representing all
the States of the Union, reasoned with them, exhorted them,
entreated them; brought all those wondrously conciliatory
talents with which he was gifted, to bear personally upon each
member he could reach; and after the most laborious and exhausting
efforts, succeeded in passing the Compromise, which, at
last, quieted the Missouri question. It consisted substantially
in referring the subject to the National Judiciary, to whose province
it undoubtedly belonged, and to whose solemn decision the
North should, from the beginning, have been content to leave it.
That it has never been settled by this high authority, and that
we are still unable to answer the apparently simple question&mdash;&#8220;Who
are citizens of the United States?&#8221;&mdash;is certainly a very
singular predicament for a great people to be placed in, but one
for which the South are in no way to blame.</p>

<p>The violent sectional feeling, however, to which this discussion
had given birth, had sunk too deeply into the hearts of the people
to be eradicated by any Compromise. Its baneful effects have
been since witnessed in the manner in which every great national
question has been debated. We cannot, of course, fill our pages
with references to these really irrelevant matters, nor have we
space to follow in all its developments, the illiberal policy pursued
by Congress with regard to petitions from the North upon
this subject. The treatment to which they have been subjected
is generally known, and the reasons for and against it too well
understood to require rehearsing.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>During the fifteen or twenty years following, the feeling
against slavery grew constantly stronger in the Northern States,
and gradually assumed a more thoroughly organized character.
Anti-Slavery Societies were formed in the latter part of this
period; the all-powerful machinery of the press was called in to
sustain the movement; public discussions on the subject attracted
general attention; and all possible means were employed, which
the leaders of the party could devise, to propagate their views.
The provisions of the Fugitive Law of 1793 began to be, for the
first time, severely commented upon. The various laws which
different States had passed, with a view to its impartial administration,
were strictly scrutinized, and the Act itself denounced
as arbitrary and unconstitutional. The State of Pennsylvania,
unwilling that the freedom of negroes within her borders should
be allowed to depend upon the unassisted judgment of Magistrates
of the lowest jurisdiction, passed an Act in 1826 requiring
all such cases to be heard before the Judges of the County
Courts. In 1842, this law was declared unconstitutional by the
Supreme Court, in the celebrated case of Prigg v. the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania. In consequence of this decision, the
Legislature passed an Act which had already been adopted in
several of the Free States, by which all State Magistrates and
Judges were forbidden to take cognizance of cases of fugitive
slaves, the jails of the State were closed against the masters,
and the whole subject was left to the jurisdiction of Congress,
where it properly belonged.</p>

<p>Such was the state of public feeling, when the annexation of
Texas and the conquests won from Mexico called upon Congress
to legislate for a new and enormous territory. A large portion
of the northern members adhered to the platform laid down by
them in the struggle of 1819, resolving that nothing should induce
them to swerve from the great principle established by the
ordinance of 1787. The extraordinary rapidity with which the
gold fever peopled California, and her consequent application for
admission into the Union, doubled the difficulty; while the toleration
of the domestic slave trade in the District of Columbia,
the unsettled boundaries of Texas, and the complaints which both
parties insisted upon, with regard to the old Act for the recapture
of fugitives, were each in itself sufficient to embarrass the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
famous Congress of 1850. The men who prepared to meet this
swarm of dangers were, probably, superior to any that had ever
coped with the question before&mdash;veterans in the Cabinet and on
the floor&mdash;men who had grown grey in watching the Constitution&mdash;who
had received it in their childhood from its framers,
and who had guarded its safety for nearly half a century with
almost superstitious love. To review the famous debate which
led to that Compromise, which swallowed up all other Compromises,
on the broad platform of which all parties have learned to
stand, though, perhaps, not very harmoniously, and in the universality
of which all minor distinctions are forgotten, would be
a lengthy, and is, happily, an unnecessary task. No one, who
will read this paper, needs to be reminded of events so recent,
and so widely interesting, that every school-boy in the land has
thoroughly mastered them and is prepared with a long train of
reasoning in their support or condemnation. Our only object has
been to show their historical connection with the many measures
that have indirectly aided in producing them, and that object, it
is hoped, has been partially accomplished.</p>

<p>The success of this measure, time alone can determine. It has
lived thus long amid great extremes, both of popular favor and
odium. So far as the Fugitive Slave Law is concerned, the
severest ordeal through which it has passed, and one in which its
practical working has been most fully displayed, is undoubtedly
the Trial of Hanway, to a brief history of which the attention of
the reader is now invited.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE TREASON TRIALS.</h2></div>


<p>On the 9th of September, A. D. 1851, Mr. Edward Gorsuch,
a citizen of Maryland, residing near Baltimore, appeared before
Edward D. Ingraham, Esq., U. S. Commissioner for Philadelphia,
and asked for warrants under the Act of Congress of the 18th
Sept. 1850, for the arrest of four of his slaves whom he had heard
were secreted somewhere in Lancaster County. Warrants were
issued forthwith, directed to H. H. Kline, a deputy U. S. Marshal,
authorizing him to arrest George Hammond, Joshua Hammond,
Nelson Ford, and Noah Buley, persons held to service or
labor in the State of Maryland, and bring them before the said
Commissioner.</p>

<p>Mr. Gorsuch then made arrangements with John Agin and
Thompson Tully, residents of Philadelphia, and police officers, to
assist Kline in making the arrests. They were to meet Mr.
Gorsuch and some companions at Penningtonville, a small place
on the State railroad, about 50 miles from Philadelphia. Kline,
with the warrants, left Philadelphia, on the same day about
2 P. M. for West Chester. Here he hired a conveyance and rode
on to Gallagherville. Here he hired another conveyance to take
him to Penningtonville. Before he had driven very far, the carriage
breaking down, he returned to Gallagherville, procured
another and started again. Owing to this detention, he was
prevented from meeting Mr. Gorsuch and his friends at the appointed
time. When he reached Penningtonville, about 2 A. M.,
on the 10th September, they had gone.</p>

<p>On entering the tavern, the place of rendezvous, he saw a
colored man whom he recognized as Samuel Williams, a resident
of Philadelphia. To put him off his guard, Kline asked the landlord
some questions about horse thieves. Williams replied that
he had seen them, and told Kline he had come too late.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>Kline then drove on to the Gap. Seeing a person he believed
to be Williams following him, he stopped at several taverns along
the road to make inquiries about horse thieves. He reached the
Gap about 3 A. M., put up the horses and went to bed. At half
past four he got up, ate breakfast, and rode to Parksburg, about
45 miles from Philadelphia, on the same railroad. Here he found
Agin and Tully asleep in the bar room. He awoke Agin, called
him aside, and inquired for Mr. Gorsuch and his party. He was
told they had gone to Sadsbury, a small place on the turnpike,
four or five miles from Parksburg.</p>

<p>On going there, he found them, about 9 A. M. on the 10th Sept.
Kline told them he had seen Agin and Tully, who had determined
to return to Philadelphia, and proposed that the whole party
should return to Gallagherville. Mr. Gorsuch, however, determined
to go to Parksburg instead, to see Agin and Tully, and
attempt to persuade them not to return. The rest of the party
were to go to Gallagherville, while Kline returned to Downingtown,
to see Agin and Tully there, should Mr. Gorsuch fail
to meet them at Parksburg. He left Gallagherville about 11
A. M., and met Agin and Tully at Downingtown. Agin said he
had seen Mr. Gorsuch, but refused to go back. He promised
however to return from Philadelphia in the evening cars. Kline
returned to Downingtown, and then met all the party except Mr.
Edward Gorsuch, who had remained behind to make the necessary
arrangements for procuring a guide to the houses where he had
been informed his negroes were to be found.</p>

<p>About 3 P. M., Mr. Edward Gorsuch joined them at Gallagherville,
and at 11 P. M. on the night of the 10th Sept., they all
went in the cars down to Downingtown, where they waited for the
evening train from Philadelphia.</p>

<p>When it arrived, neither Agin nor Tully were to be seen. The
rest of the party went up to the Gap, which they reached about
half past one on the morning of the 11th Sept. They then continued
their journey on foot towards Christiana. The party then
consisted of Kline, Edward Gorsuch, Dickinson Gorsuch, his son,
Joshua M. Gorsuch, his nephew, Dr. Thomas Pierce, Nicholas T.
Hutchings and Nathan Nelson.</p>

<p>After they had proceeded about a mile, they met a man who
was represented to be a guide. He is said to have been disguised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
in such a way that none of the party could recognize him, and his
name is not mentioned in any of the proceedings. It is probable
that he was employed by Mr. Edward Gorsuch, and one condition
of his services might have been that he should be allowed to use
every possible means of concealing his face and name from the
rest of the party. Under his conduct, the party went on and
soon reached a house in which they were told one of the slaves
was to be found. Mr. Gorsuch wished to send part of the company
after him, but Kline was unwilling to divide their strength,
and they walked on, intending to return that way after making
the other arrests.</p>

<p>The guide led them by a circuitous route until they reached
the Valley Road near Parker&#8217;s house, their point of destination.
They halted in a lane near by, ate some crackers and cheese
provided by one of their number, examined the condition of their
fire arms, and consulted upon the plan of the attack. A short
walk brought them to the orchard in front of Parker&#8217;s house,
which the guide pointed out and then left them. He had no desire
to remain and witness the result of his false information.
His disguise and desertion of his employer, are strong circumstances
in proof of the fact that he knew he was misleading the party.
On the trial of Hanway it was proven by the defence that Nelson
Ford was not on the ground until after the sun was up. Joshua
Hammond had lived in the vicinity up to the time that a man
by the name of Williams had been kidnapped, when he and several
others departed, and had not been heard from afterwards. Of
the two others, one at least, if the evidence for the prosecution is
to be relied upon, was in the house at which the party first halted,
so that there could not have been more than one of Mr.
Gorsuch&#8217;s slaves in Parker&#8217;s house, and of this there is no positive
testimony.</p>

<p>It was not daybreak when the party approached the house.
They made demand for the slaves, and threatened to shoot them
or burn the house down if they would not surrender. At this
time, the number of besiegers seems to have been increased, and
as many as fifteen are said to have been near the house. By
daybreak and before entrance was made into the house, the party
was diminished to the original number. When they were advancing
a second or third time, they saw a negro going up whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
Mr. Gorsuch thought he recognized as one of his slaves. Kline
pursued him with a revolver in his hand, and stumbled over the
bars near the house. Some of the company came up before him
and found the door open. They entered, and Kline following
called for the owner, ordered all to come down, and said he had
two warrants for the arrest of Nelson Ford and Joshua Hammond.
He was answered that there were no such men in the house.
Kline followed by Mr. Gorsuch attempted to go up stairs. They
were prevented from ascending by what appears to have been an
ordinary <i>fish gig</i>. Some of the witnesses described it as &#8220;like a
pitchfork with blunt prongs,&#8221; and others were at a loss what to
call this, the first weapon used in the contest. A pitchfork any
of the party would have recognized, as the most of them were
farmers; besides, this is not a weapon usually kept in dwelling
houses. This had &#8220;four or five prongs&#8221; and was probably an
old fish gig, which had been stored away for safe keeping. An
axe was next thrown down, but hit no one.</p>

<p>Mr. Gorsuch and others then went outside to talk with the
negroes at the window. Just at this time Kline fired his
pistol up stairs. The warrants were then read outside the house,
and demand made upon the landlord. No answer was heard.
After a short interval, Kline proposed to withdraw his men, but
Mr. Gorsuch refused, and said he would not leave the ground
until he had made the arrests. Kline then in a loud voice ordered
some one to go to the sheriff and bring a hundred men, thinking,
as he afterwards said, this would intimidate them. This threat
appears to have had some effect, for the negroes asked time to
consider. The party outside agreed to fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>During these scenes at the house, there were occurrences elsewhere
which are worthy of attention, but cannot be understood
without a short statement of previous facts.</p>

<p>In the month of Sept. 1850, a colored man, known in the neighborhood
around Christiana to be free, was seized and carried
away by men known to be professional kidnappers, and has never
been seen by his family since. In March 1851, in the same
neighborhood, under the roof of his employer, during the night,
another colored man was tied, gagged, and carried away, marking
the road along which he was dragged by his own blood. No
authority for this outrage was ever shown, and he has never been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
heard from. These and many other acts of a similar kind, had
so alarmed the neighborhood that the very name of kidnapper
was sufficient to create a panic. The blacks feared for their own
safety, and the whites knowing their feelings, were apprehensive
that any attempt to repeat these outrages would be the cause of
bloodshed. Many good citizens were determined to do all in
their power to prevent these lawless depredations, though they
were ever ready to submit to any measures sanctioned by legal
process. They regretted the existence among them of a body of
people liable to such violence; but without combination, had, each
for himself, resolved that they would do everything dictated by
humanity to resist barbarous oppression.</p>

<p>On the morning in question, a colored man living in the
neighborhood, who was passing Parker&#8217;s house at an early hour,
saw the yard full of men. He halted, and was met by a man
who presented a pistol at him, and ordered him to leave the
place. He went away and hastened over to the store kept by
Elijah Lewis, which, like all places of that kind, was probably
the headquarters of news in the neighborhood. Mr. Lewis was
in the act of opening his store when this man told him that
&#8220;Parker&#8217;s house was surrounded by <i>kidnappers</i>, who had broken
into the house, and <i>were trying to get him away</i>.&#8221; Lewis, not
questioning the truth of the statement, repaired immediately to
the place. On the way he passed Castner Hanway&#8217;s house,
and telling him what he had heard, asked him to go over to
Parker&#8217;s house. Hanway was in feeble health and unable to
undergo the fatigue of walking that distance. He saddled his
horse, and reached Parker&#8217;s during the armistice.</p>

<p>Having no reason to believe he was acting under legal authority,
when Kline approached and demanded assistance in making
the arrests, Hanway made him no answer. Kline then handed
him the warrants, which Hanway examined, saw they appeared
genuine, and returned them.</p>

<p>At this time, several colored men, who no doubt had heard
the report that kidnappers were about, came up, armed with such
weapons as they could suddenly lay hands upon. How many
there were on the ground during the affray it is <i>now</i> impossible
to determine. The witnesses on both sides vary materially in
their estimate. Some said they saw a dozen or fifteen; some,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
thirty or forty; and others maintained, as many as two or three
hundred. It is known there were not two hundred colored men
to be found within eight miles of Parker&#8217;s house, nor half that
number within four miles, and it would have been almost impossible
to get together even thirty at an hour&#8217;s notice. It is probable
there were about twenty-five, all told, at or near the house
from the beginning of the affray until all was quiet again. These
the fears of those who afterwards testified to larger numbers,
might easily have magnified to fifty or a hundred.</p>

<p>While Kline and Hanway were in conversation, Elijah Lewis
came up. Hanway said to him, &#8220;Here is the marshal.&#8221; Lewis
asked to see his authority, and Kline handed him one of the
warrants. When he saw the signature of the U. S. Commissioner,
&#8220;he took it for granted that Kline had authority.&#8221; Kline
then ordered Hanway and Lewis to assist in arresting the alleged
fugitives. Hanway refused to have anything to do with it. The
negroes around these three men seeming disposed to make an
attack, Hanway &#8220;motioned to them and urged them back.&#8221; He
then &#8220;advised Kline that it would be dangerous to attempt
making arrests, and that they had better leave.&#8221; Kline, after
saying he would hold them accountable for the negroes, promised
to leave, and beckoned two or three times to his men to retire.</p>

<p>The negroes then rushed up, some armed with guns, some
with corn-cutters, staves, clubs, others with stones or whatever
weapon chance offered. Hanway and Lewis in vain endeavored
to restrain them.</p>

<p>Kline leaped the fence, passed through the standing grain in
the field, and for a few moments was out of sight. Mr. Gorsuch
refused to leave the spot, saying his &#8220;property was there,
and he would have it or perish in the attempt.&#8221; The rest of
his party endeavored to retreat when they heard the marshal
calling to them, but they were too late; the negroes rushed
up and the firing began. How many times each party fired, it
is impossible to tell. For a few moments, everything was confusion
and each attempted to save himself. Nathan Nelson
went down the short lane, thence into the woods and towards
Penningtonville. Nicholas Hutchings, by direction of Kline,
followed Lewis to see where he went. Thomas Pierce and
Joshua Gorsuch went down the long lane, pursued by some of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
negroes, caught up with Hanway, and shielding themselves behind
his horse, followed him to a run of water near by. Dickinson
Gorsuch was with his father near the house. They were
both wounded; the father mortally. Dickinson escaped down
the lane, where he was met by Kline, who had returned from
the woods at the end of the field. Kline rendered him assistance,
and went towards Penningtonville for a physician. On
his way he met Joshua M. Gorsuch, who was also wounded and
delirious. Kline led him over to Penningtonville and placed
him on the upward train from Philadelphia. Before this time
several persons living in the neighborhood had arrived at Parker&#8217;s
house. Lewis Cooper found D. Gorsuch in the place
where Kline had left him, attended by Joseph Scarlett. He
placed him in his dearborn, and carried him to the house of Levi
Pownall, where he remained till he had sufficiently recovered to
return home. Mr. Cooper then returned to Parker&#8217;s, placed
the body of Mr. E. Gorsuch in the same dearborn, and carried
it to Christiana. Neither Nelson nor Hutchings rejoined their
party, but during the day went by the railroad to Lancaster.</p>

<p>Thus ended an occurrence which has been the theme of conversation
throughout the land. Not more than two hours had
elapsed from the time demand was first made at Parker&#8217;s house
until the dead body of Edward Gorsuch was carried to Christiana.
In that brief time the blood of strangers had been
spilled in a sudden affray, an unfortunate man had been killed
and two others badly wounded. How many of the negroes were
wounded, has never been ascertained. All could not have
escaped, but no one has been able to discover who were injured.</p>

<p>When rumor had spread abroad the result of this sad affray,
the neighborhood was appalled. The inhabitants of the farm
houses and the villages around, unused to scenes of this kind,
could not at first believe that it had occurred in their midst.
Before midday, exaggerated accounts had reached Philadelphia,
and were transmitted by telegraph through the country.</p>

<p>The first information the public received, was that &#8220;the
negroes had determined to prevent the arrest of the slaves; that
about eighty of them, armed with guns, &amp;c., had formed an ambush
in the neighboring woods and cornfields, and that when the
party arrived in search of the fugitives, they had surrounded them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
and poured upon them a deadly fire, killing Mr. Gorsuch, <i>mortally</i>
wounding one of his sons, and badly wounding an officer from
Baltimore.&#8221; These were given as &#8220;leading facts.&#8221; The next
day&#8217;s news contained the information that the U. S. Marshal,
the U. S. District Attorney, a special Commissioner from Washington
city, a company of U. S. Marines, and fifty of the Marshal&#8217;s
police, had gone to the scene of action from the city. It
was also announced to be the intention of the U. S. Marshal to
&#8220;<i>scour</i> the neighborhood,&#8221; and that Judges Grier and Kane
(of the U. S. Courts, before whom the case was afterwards tried,)
had <i>decided</i> the offence of the rioters to be treason against the
U. S.</p>

<p>Such statements as these naturally aroused the whole community,
and it was not until a few days had developed the exact
truth, that public excitement began to subside. Believing the
published accounts of the transaction to be correct, a number of
the citizens of Philadelphia addressed the following letter to the
Chief Executive of the State, who happened then to be in the
city, urging upon him prompt action, in what they considered an
important crisis:</p>

<blockquote>

<p><i>To the Governor of Pennsylvania</i>:</p>

<p>The undersigned, citizens of Pennsylvania, respectfully represent:</p>

<p>That citizens of a neighboring State have been cruelly assassinated by
a band of armed outlaws, at a place not more than three hours&#8217; journey
distant from the seat of government and from the commercial metropolis
of the State.</p>

<p>That this insurrectionary movement, in one of the most populous parts
of the State, has been so far successful as to overawe the local ministers
of justice, and paralyze the powers of the law.</p>

<p>That your memorialists are not aware that &#8220;any military force&#8221; has
been sent to the seat of the insurrection, or that the civil authority has
been strengthened by the adoption of any measure suited to the momentous
crisis.</p>

<p>They, therefore, respectfully request the chief executive magistrate of
Pennsylvania to take into consideration the necessity of vindicating the
outraged laws, and sustaining the dignity of the Commonwealth on this
important and melancholy occasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>The Governor, who, as far as was in his power, had apprized
himself of the facts of the case, and had taken the measures which
devolved upon him by reason of his office, replied immediately.
He knew the danger of inflaming the public mind upon a subject
which was then exciting the whole Union. The law had prescribed
the proper officers to act in every emergency, and he
knew they were upon the alert, with their police force strengthened
for the occasion. Whatever might have been the motive
for addressing the Governor, the following letter was a full and
sufficient answer.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Philadelphia</span>, Sept. 14, 1851.</p>


<div class="hangingindent">
<p>To Messrs. John Cadwalader, A. L. Roumfort, Jas. Page, C. Ingersoll, Isaac

</div>

<p><i>Gentlemen</i>&mdash;Your letter, without date, was this afternoon put into
my hands by one of the servants of the hotel. The anxiety which you
manifested to maintain the laws of the land and the public peace, is fully
appreciated, and I have great pleasure in informing you that, more than
twenty-four hours before the receipt of your letter, the parties implicated
had been, through the vigilance and decision of the local authorities,
arrested, and are now in prison, awaiting an inquiry into their
imputed guilt. The District Attorney and Sheriff of Lancaster county,
acting in concert with the Attorney-General of the State, deserve especial
thanks for their prompt and energetic conduct. This was all done
early on Saturday morning, and duly reported to me by the local
officers.</p>

<p>The testimony taken by the U. S. Commissioner, who arrived at a
later period on the ground, a printed copy of which has accidentally
reached me this afternoon, confirms me in the belief that the State
authorities had vindicated the law, and, to a large extent, arrested the
perpetrators of the crimes.</p>

<p>The cruel murder of a citizen of a neighboring State, accompanied by
a gross outrage on the laws of the United States, in the resistance of
its processes, has been committed; and you may be assured that so soon
as the guilty agents are ascertained, they will be punished to its severest
penalty by the law of Pennsylvania. I am very proud that the first
steps to detect and arrest these offenders have been taken by Pennsylvania
officers.</p>

<p>Permit me, gentlemen, having thus removed all just cause of anxiety
from your minds, respectfully to suggest that the idea of rebellion, or
&#8220;insurrectionary movement&#8221; in the county of Lancaster, or anywhere
else in this Commonwealth, has no real foundation, and is an offensive imputation
on a large body of our fellow citizens. There is no insurrectionary
movement in Lancaster county, and there would be no occasion to march
a military force there, as you seem to desire, and inflame the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
mind by any such strange exaggeration. I do not wish our brethren of
the Union to think that, in any part of this State, resistance to the law
goes undetected or unpunished, or that there exists such a sentiment as
treason to the Union and the constitution. The alleged murderers of
Mr. Gorsuch, whose crime is deep enough without exaggerating it,
have been arrested, and will be tried, and they and their abettors be
made to answer for what they have done in contravention of the law.
But in the meantime, let me invite your co-operation, as citizens of
Pennsylvania, not only to see that the law is enforced, but to add to the
confidence which we all feel in the judicial tribunals of the land, by
abstaining from undue violence of language, and letting the law take
its course. Depend upon it, gentlemen, there is in Lancaster county a
sense of duty to the laws of the land, manifested in the easy and prompt
arrest of these offenders, which will on all occasions show itself in practical
obedience.</p>

<p>The people of that county are men of peace and good order, and not
easily led aside from the path of duty which the Constitution prescribes.
They, and every Pennsylvanian, love the Constitution and the Union.
They will detect, as they have done in this case, and arrest and punish
all who violate the laws of the land. There is no warrant, depend upon it,
for representing the men of Lancaster county as traitors, and participants
in an &#8220;insurrectionary movement.&#8221; You do them, unintentionally I
have no doubt, great injustice.</p>

<p>I am deeply indebted to you for affording me this opportunity of
expressing my views. But for your communication I might not have
been able to do so. You, and my fellow-citizens at large, may be
assured of my firm determination, at all hazards, and under all circumstances,
to maintain the supremacy of the Constitution, and enforce
obedience to the laws alike of the United States and of this Commonwealth.</p>

<p>In order that I may be sure that my answer may reach its destination,
(your letter having but accidentally come to my hands,) I have requested
Mr. White to put it in the hands of Mr. John Cadwalader, whose signature,
I observe, is first.</p>

<p class="right">
<span class="gap2">I am, with great respect,</span><br />
<span class="gap">Your obedient servant,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Wm. F. Johnston</span>.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The Governor, however, had been misinformed, and was wrong
in stating that the murderers of Edward Gorsuch had been
arrested. Every man who was in Parker&#8217;s house, including
Parker himself, escaped. As was afterwards proven, not one of
the guilty parties was secured. So soon as this was ascertained
the following proclamation was issued:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>


<p class="center">PROCLAMATION.</p>

<blockquote>
<div class="hangingindent">
<p>
In and by the authority of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, I,
William F. Johnston, Governor of said Commonwealth, do hereby
issue this</p></div>


<p class="center">PROCLAMATION.</p>

<p>Whereas, it has been represented to me that a flagrant violation of the
public peace has occurred in Lancaster county, involving the murder of
Edward Gorsuch, and seriously endangering the lives of other persons;
and whereas, it has also been represented to me that some of the participants
in this outrage are yet at large; now, therefore, by virtue of the
authority in me vested by the Constitution and laws, I, William F.
Johnston, Governor of Pennsylvania, do hereby offer a reward of <small>ONE
THOUSAND DOLLARS</small> for the arrest and conviction of the person or persons
guilty of the murder and violation of the public peace as aforesaid.</p>

<div class="figleft"><img src="images/seal.jpg" alt="SEAL" /></div>

<p>In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and
affixed the great seal of the State, this fifteenth day of September,

and fifty-one.</p>

<p>For days after the melancholy tragedy, the vicinity of Christiana
was in possession of police officers of different classes and
grades. Many of them displayed their vigilance and valor in
a way that rendered them ridiculous in the eyes of all, except of
those who were the objects of their zeal. Passing by a number
of outrages, perpetrated, in the name of justice, by men who
were clothed with a little authority, and who delighted in terrifying
helpless women and inoffensive children, we have to speak
only of those arrests which were made seriously and in good faith,
and to tell, so far as there are any records in existence, how the
authorities arrested, by wholesale, men who afterwards were
found to have been miles from the scene of action.</p>

<p>On the day of the affray it seems that no action was taken at
Christiana for the arrest of any parties. All was confusion. The
next morning (the 12th of Sept.) Kline went before Joseph D.
Pownall, Justice of the Peace of Lancaster County, for the township
of Sadsbury, and on oath charged Elijah Lewis, Castner
Hanway, John Morgan, Henry Simms, Charles Valentine, Lewis
Clarkson, Charles Hunter, Lewis Gales, George Williams,
Alson Parnsley, Light Stewart, Hezekiah Clemens, George
Wells, Walter Harris, Abraham Clinch, Nelson Carter and Jacob
Phillips, with &#8220;aiding and abetting in the murder of Edward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Gorsuch on the morning of the 11th September, 1851,&#8221; and warrants
were issued for their arrest. As soon as Lewis and Hanway
heard of this, they went over to Christiana and surrendered
themselves to the authorities. They and the colored men were
carried to Lancaster that night, to await a further hearing
before Alderman J. Franklin Reigart, of the city of Lancaster.</p>

<p>The next day (the 13th Sept.) the train from Philadelphia
brought up the U. S. District Attorney, J. W. Ashmead; the
U. S. Commissioner, E. D. Ingraham; an Attorney who had
acted as counsel for Mr. Gorsuch, before he applied to Mr. Ingraham
in Philadelphia; a company of Marines from the
Navy Yard at Philadelphia; and a number of the Marshal&#8217;s
police.</p>

<p>These, it seems, when reinforced by such volunteers as could
be procured from the neighborhood, composed the force by which
&#8220;the country was to be scoured.&#8221; They went from house to
house with fire-arms in their hands, demanding of the people
they met whatever best suited their fancies.</p>

<p>On the same day at Christiana, the Commissioner heard the
charges against Joseph Scarlett, Wm. Brown, Ezekiel Thompson,
Daniel Clarksbury and Benjamin Pendergrast, and they, with
Isaiah Clarkson and Elijah Clark,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> were the next day (Sunday)
brought to the Moyamensing prison in Philadelphia, &#8220;to await
their trial at the next term of the Circuit Court upon the charge
of having committed treason against the United States.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the 15th (Monday) the Commissioner resumed his duties,
and heard the charges against Henry Green, Wm. Williams,
John Halliday, Wm. Brown, (second), George Read, Benjamin
Johnson, John Jackson, Thomas Butler, John Clark, Moses
Johnson, Jacob Johnson, Emory Elias, Nero Johnson, William
Henry Morgan, Aaron Wesley, Daniel Jones, William Jackson,
Peter D. Watson and William Chandler. The first eight, in
company with Samuel Williams, were on the same day sent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
Moyamensing. What became of John Clark does not appear.
The records of the prison do not show that he was ever there,
and the transcript of the Commissioner&#8217;s dockett does not say
he was discharged.</p>

<p>On the 18th September, Collister Wilson was lodged in Moyamensing
prison. It does not appear by whom he was committed.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning (the 14th Sept.) the prisoners who had
been taken to Lancaster, were again brought before Alderman
Reigart, but were remanded until Tuesday the 16th.</p>

<p>Before the 16th, it was thought advisable by those in authority,
to change the nature of the charge against the prisoners. They
had been arrested as offenders against the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania. Now they were to be considered as culprits, to
be punished by the laws of the General Government, and were
to be accused as traitors. It was probably with a view to prepare
for this, that, when they were brought to the appointed
place on the 16th, they were again remanded for one week, until
Tuesday the 23d of September.</p>

<p>It is generally considered that a man is safe from prison walls
until it has appeared to a magistrate that there is probable cause
for believing he has committed some offence that should be inquired
into by a jury of his country. Such was the common
law of England, and many believe it to be the common law of
this country. The magistrate has the right, in the exercise of a
sound discretion, to detain suspected parties a <i>reasonable</i> time,
while he hears the charges and decides whether there is necessity
for his making a formal commitment. In these extraordinary
cases, however, the operation of the law seemed to be inconvenient
to those who had its initiatory administration, and the
rule was not observed.</p>

<p>Before the appointed time, the company in the prison had
been increased. On the 18th September, Jacob Moore was
arrested on process issued by Squire Pownall.</p>

<p>The prisoners were brought up to Lancaster County Court
House about 10 A. M., and the examination began before Alderman Reigart.</p>

<p>Thomas E. Franklin, Esq., John L. Thompson, Esq., District<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
Attorney for the County of Lancaster, John W. Ashmead, Esq.,
District Attorney of the United States for the Eastern District
of Pennsylvania, and R. J. Brent, Esq., Attorney General of
the Commonwealth of Maryland, appeared as counsel to sustain
the charges against the prisoners. On their behalf appeared
the Hon. Thaddeus Stevens, George M. Kline, George Ford and
O. J. Dickey, Esqrs.</p>

<p>Twelve witnesses were examined on the part of the United
States, and about the same number on the part of the defence.
After two days deliberation, the Alderman felt it his &#8220;duty to
commit Castner Hanway, Elijah Lewis, John Morgan, Henry
Simms, Jacob Moore, Lewis Clarkson, Charles Hunter, Lewis
Gales, George Williams, Alson Parnsley, George Wells, Nelson
Carter and Jacob Woods, into the custody of the Marshal of the
U. S. for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, to answer at the
next session of the U. S. Circuit Court, the charge of having
committed Treason against the United States and aiding and
abetting in the murder of Edward Gorsuch, a worthy citizen of
the State of Maryland.&#8221; They were accordingly brought down
to the Moyamensing Prison on the 25th of September.</p>

<p>H. Clemens, A. Clinch, W. Harris, J. Phillips, L. Stewart
and C. Valentine were discharged, having been detained in
prison from the 12th to the 25th of September to await their
examination. Jacob Woods, the man last mentioned, does not
appear to have been arrested. He was, towards the close of the
examination, upon the witness stand, virtually, though not formally,
as state&#8217;s evidence. It appearing that his testimony implicated
himself more than any one else, was probably the cause of
his detention as prisoner instead of witness.</p>

<p>On Monday the 29th of September, &#8220;in consequence of the
determination of the District Attorney to send bills to the Grand
Jury indicting for Treason those accused of participation in the
Christiana riot,&#8221; Judge Kane charged that body at length upon
the law which should govern them in their inquiries. This course
was required of the Judge by his duties as a public officer; yet
many were surprised that he should have taken as the basis of
his charge statements which many persons knew to be purely
imaginative.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>He stated briefly the occurrences at Parker&#8217;s house on the
morning of the 11th September as he had heard them, and that
&#8220;it was said that the time and manner of these outrages evinced
a combined purpose forcibly to resist and make nugatory a constitutional
provision; and in confirmation of this, it is added,
that for some months past gatherings of people, strangers as well
as citizens, have been held from time to time in the vicinity of
the place of the recent outbreak, at which exhortations were
made and pledges were interchanged to hold the law for the recovery
of fugitive slaves as of no validity, and to defy its execution.&#8221;
Personally, however, the learned Judge said he knew
nothing of the facts, and had attempted to preserve his mind free
and unprejudiced, being one of the members of the tribunal
before which the accused might be tried.</p>

<p>If the circumstances mentioned had taken place, the Judge
was correct in saying the highest crime known to the laws of the
United States had been committed at Christiana. He cited
many authorities, and concluded by stating with what misdemeanors
the prisoners could be charged, under the acts of Congress,
if the Grand Jury were of opinion that treason had not
been committed.</p>

<p>On Friday of the same week (Oct. 13) the Grand Jury returned
true bills charging the following men with Treason.</p>

<p>(White). C. Hanway, E. Lewis, J. Scarlett, and James Jackson.</p>

<p>(Colored). J. Moore, G. Reed, B. Johnson, D. Caulsberry, A.
Parnsley, W. Brown, (2nd), H. Green, E. Clark, J. Holladay,
W. Williams, B. Pendergrast, J. Morgan, E. Thompson, T. Butler,
C. Wilson, J. Jackson, W. Brown, J. Clarkson, H. Sims, C.
Hunter, L. Gales, P. Woods, L. Clarkson, N. Carter, W. Parker,
J. Berry, W. Berry and G. Williams.</p>

<p>One charging George Wells (colored) with the same offence,
was ignored.</p>

<p>On the next day, like bills were returned against S. Williams,
J. Hammond, H. Curtis, W. Williams, W. Thomas and N. Ferd.</p>

<p>The bill against Noah Buley was ignored.</p>

<p>On the following Monday, the 6th of October, the U. S. Circuit
Court, in which the prisoners were to be tried, held its session.
The District Attorney moved for a special venire to issue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
to the Marshal to summon 108 Jurors, 12 of whom were to be
from Lancaster County, &#8220;to try the charges against Elijah
Lewis and 37 others who had been committed for treason against
the United States growing out of the murderous outrage at
Christiana.&#8221; He announced that he would move for the arraignment
of the prisoners on the following Thursday, and that the
fourth Monday of November had been fixed for the trials. Judge
Grier said that such a motion was strictly proper, and he directed
the Marshal &#8220;to summon men of the highest respectability
of character, for intelligence, integrity and conscientiousness, in
the community, and to inform them that their attendance will be
enforced by the Court, and that no excuse but sickness would be
received for non-attendance.&#8221;</p>

<p>The arraignment did not take place the next Thursday, for
reasons best known to the District Attorney. No further public
proceedings were had until the trial. In the mean time the
Traitors were made as comfortable by the attentions of their
friends as the rules of the prison permitted. Though the building
was erected at an enormous expense, it is badly ventilated
and miserably heated. Yet the rules did not permit any of the
prisoners to have fire in their cells, which at that season of the
year was absolutely essential to their comfort. Some of them,
predisposed to pulmonary complaints, suffered severely on account
of this privation. Before the termination of the trial the
Court ordered the Marshal to provide more suitable quarters for
two of them, representations having been made by their counsel
that this precaution was necessary to preserve their health and
probably their lives.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning, Nov. 9, about 4 o&#8217;clock, two of the witnesses
for the prosecution, who had been detained in the Debtors
apartment of the Moyamensing Prison, made their escape, by
means of the shutters of their cells and their blankets. A white
man who was under confinement on another charge went with
them.</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning, in the District Court, the District
Attorney, after stating the facts, asked for a writ of Habeas
Corpus directed to the keeper of the Debtor&#8217;s apartment, returnable
on the following Friday, directing him to bring forth
the runaways. On Friday, the keeper asked for more time to
make answer, and the following Monday was appointed. On<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
Monday, it appeared by the statements of some of the counsel for
the defence that the truant witnesses were more important for
the cause of the prisoners than for the prosecution, and they came
into court to complain of the escape as prejudicing their clients.
The District Attorney undertook to controvert this position, and
argued that because these witnesses were receiving $1.25 per day
from the United States while in confinement, more than they
could have earned if at liberty, their escape was not their own
act and deed. A strange and novel doctrine! Most men, whatever
their complexion, would prefer the light and air of heaven
at 50 cents per day, to a cell 8 by 12, in a prison notorious for
its poor ventilation, at $1.25. This was, however, the only evidence
of &#8220;assistance from without,&#8221; which the U. S. Counsel so
frequently insinuated, and upon which Mr. Brent, in his official
report, rings such doleful changes, charging treachery on the
part of some officer <i>within</i> the walls of the prison. The public
was therefore informed by one official dignitary, that these witnesses
were assisted <i>from without</i>; another tells us assistance
came <i>from within</i>.</p>

<p>Leaving out of the question the universal preference for the
<i>outside</i> of prison walls, there are two circumstances to be considered
in relation to this escape, which, when told, the public
will be as well able to surmise the truth as any attornies, whether
in or out of office. These fugitives were confined as witnesses,
not as defendants upon <i>any</i> charge. Their friends, or the friends
of emancipation, had not the same access to them the law gave
to the prisoners. Being detained to testify on behalf of the
United States, they were under the strict and especial charge of
the government officers.</p>

<p>Besides, the Moyamensing prison is notoriously insecure.
Scarcely a month passes by that there are not escapes. The
iron bars in the windows of each cell are merely let into the
mortar, which a prisoner has only to remove with his knife.
The bar can then easily be displaced; and if a little management
is used to escape the observation of the keepers, a defendant
need not wait for the verdict of a jury to restore him to
liberty.</p>

<p>On the investigation of the law relating to the matter, it was
found that the keeper of the debtor&#8217;s apartment was not amenable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
to the United States District Court. The inquiry was
accordingly dropped, informally.</p>

<p>On the same morning, at the instance of the District Attorney,
it was ordered that the bills against the prisoners be certified
to the U. S. Circuit Court, and he announced that Castner
Hanway would be tried on the following Monday. John
Jackson, it was also said, would be tried immediately after
Hanway.</p>

<p>During the week, the preparations made on both sides were
conducted in private; but one or two matters that excited some
attention were permitted to make their way into the public prints.
The entire private history of the difficulty which required the
umpirage of the authorities at Washington, would be peculiarly
<i>piquant</i>. But we have undertaken only an epitome of such matters
as were made public, and would be digressing from the
course marked out, were we to go &#8220;behind the scenes.&#8221;</p>

<p>It appears that as soon as the preliminary examinations were
concluded, and it was determined to try the offenders upon the
charge of treason against the United States, intimation was received
from Washington by the authorities in Philadelphia, that
the Administration desired no pains should be spared in conducting
the trials with energy, and in a style worthy the occasion.
The learned District Attorney for the United States obeyed these
instructions to the very letter. Counsel were retained to assist
him. The country was searched to procure the necessary evidence.
Arguments were prepared beforehand, and briefs drawn
by skilful hands to be used at the proper time. Before these
preliminaries were quite concluded, letters were received from
the Attorney-General of a neighboring State, which, by their
tone, plainly showed that the writer considered himself entitled
to the management of the whole matter, and offers, it is said,
were made to the authorities here and their colleagues, to take
the control of such portions of the trials as this professional
usurper chose to assign them? No proposition like this could
be entertained. The <i>dramatis person</i> had all been assigned
their parts, and had studied their speeches. The machinery had
been adjusted for a certain number of wheels, and more than
these would clog the movement. Answer was made that there
were no vacancies to be supplied; but if the Attorney-General<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
chose to be present, some alteration might, perhaps, be made in
the programme.</p>

<p>The chief Executive of the State he represented, would not
permit his officer to be thus rebuffed. Complaint was formally
lodged at Washington, the result of which was, that the whole
management of the case was altered. The then Secretary of
State wished to <i>compromise</i>; and when the District Attorney of
the United States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania
arrived from Philadelphia, he was told that the affair was unfortunate
indeed, but an alteration was unavoidable. The
Attorney-General must be allowed to have his own way; and
those who had expended their time and talents in making the
proper preparations of the case, were to acknowledge him as
their leader.</p>

<p>The effect of this misunderstanding was manifest upon the
trial, and to it is solely attributable the fact that, professionally
speaking, the management of the prosecution in Hanway&#8217;s case
was, in many respects, a complete blunder. Had the original
intentions been pursued to completion, the Bar of Philadelphia
would not have been surprised by the imbecile efforts that were
made from time to time to bolster up the mistakes and omissions
constantly resulting from a misapprehension of both the law and
the facts of the case, on the part of those who had assumed its
management.</p>

<p>The papers of Saturday, the 22d of November, announced that
the trials would begin on Monday, and added, that &#8220;Such conveniences
as the limited room in which the trials are to take
place (would allow) have been prepared; but they are totally
inadequate to the occasion, and we shall not be surprised to hear
of <i>hundreds</i> being disappointed who would like to hear the evidence
and the arguments of counsel.&#8221;</p>

<p>This alone would be a sufficient answer to the absurdity of the
statements made by Mr. Brent in his official report, in regard
to the favors shown by the Marshal to the male and female members
of the Anti-Slavery Society, and to free negroes. The extract
is made from &#8220;Cummings&#8217; Evening Bulletin,&#8221;&mdash;the authority
Mr. Brent cites in support of his allegations. It was penned
before the commencement of the trial, and may be considered as
the testimony of an unbiassed witness.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>If, however, the Governor of Maryland, to whom Mr. Brent&#8217;s
report is made, had taken the trouble to examine the files of the
paper in question, he would have found that on the first day of the
trial, the reporter says: &#8220;Long before the hour arrived for the
Court to meet, the seats were occupied by <i>white</i> men, and <i>not a
female</i> made her appearance. We did not see a colored man in
the room.&#8221; In the account of the second day, he says: &#8220;A
very few members of the Society of Friends were present; and
these few were probably the personal friends of Hanway.&#8221; In
the report of the third day, no remark is made about persons present.
The reporter, however, says: &#8220;The seating of every
person who desires to be present cannot, of course, be accomplished.&#8221;
On the fourth day, it is said: &#8220;The same absence of
colored persons is visible.&#8221; Throughout the whole trial, no
mention is made of colored persons <i>in the Court room</i>, except
those brought up from prison to be identified by the witness
Kline.</p>

<p>The exclusion of &#8220;a respectable gentleman from Maryland,&#8221;
one of the witnesses,&mdash;mentioned by Mr. B., is not a case of extremity.
During the examination of the witnesses who were
called to testify to Kline&#8217;s good character, a gentleman of Philadelphia,
a member of the Bar, and consequently an <i>officer of
the Court</i>, who had been subp&oelig;naed, when called to the stand,
before he answered the questions asked him, complained to the
Judges that he had been denied admission to the Court room.
Towards the close of the trial another member of the Bar complained
to the Court of the same thing. In both cases the Marshal
was called to account, and justified the conduct of his
deputies by saying the room was too small to admit all who desired
to be present. The Judge told him to do the best he could,
and that all members of the Bar <i>must</i> be admitted.</p>

<p>The writer of this went away more than a dozen times because
it was impossible to get near the door, and saw hundreds do the
same thing. He was personally known to every officer of the
Court, and could have gained admission had there been standing
room.</p>

<p>Those who wished to hear and see, secured their places betimes.
If Mr. Brent had read his favorite authority more closely,
he would have seen that the reporter remarks jocosely upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
the perseverance and patience of those who &#8220;secured their seats
by seven o&#8217;clock A. M., and waited till ten for the opening of
the Court.&#8221; Had the &#8220;respectable gentleman from Maryland&#8221;
been out of bed in time, he might have secured a front seat.</p>

<p>On Monday, the twenty-fourth of November, the Trial was
commenced at eleven o&#8217;clock A. M., in the United States Court
room, at Philadelphia. The entire second floor of the building,
known as Independence Hall, is leased by the General Government
for the sittings of the Circuit and District Courts. The
eastern portion, immediately over the room in which Congress
held its sessions when Independence was declared, is divided into
the offices of the Clerk and Marshal, Jury and Witness rooms, &amp;c.
The western portion is the Court room, and is probably one of
the most elegantly furnished, for court purposes, in the country.
The learned Judge of the District Court takes great pride in
having everything about him conducted in the most polished
style, and few Courts can boast of more urbane and polite attendants
than the Circuit and District Courts of the United
States for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>For all ordinary purposes, for admiralty causes, the hearing
of patent cases, and other business usually transacted in these
Courts, the room is sufficiently large. But on occasions attracting
much of public attention, great inconvenience is felt by
all whose duties compel them to be in attendance; and during
the trial of Castner Hanway, as has just been seen, complaints
were loud and frequent.</p>

<p>For this occasion the room had been refitted. Gas fixtures of
the chastest designs had been erected, in anticipation of evening
sessions. Ventilators of the most appropriate patterns had been
placed in the ceiling, controlled by cords terminating at the
bench of the Judges, so that a uniform temperature could be
preserved. Nothing was wanting but space to promote the ease
and comfort of those who were to figure in the solemn investigation
about to take place.</p>

<p>Long before the appointed hour, the Court room was filled
with persons anxious to witness the opening ceremonies. Officers
were in attendance to see that the spectators were seated,
and no more were admitted than the room would contain comfortably.
In the lobbies and on the stair-way, policemen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
were stationed to prevent the crowd from rushing up, to allow
those to pass who had been called thither by duty, and to preserve
order below. For the first ten days they were retained on
duty, their number being diminished by degrees until public
curiosity had subsided.</p>

<p>At eleven o&#8217;clock, Judges Grier and Kane took their seats, and
the Court was opened by the usual proclamation. The clerk
called the names of one hundred and sixteen persons who had
been summoned by the Marshal to attend as Jurors. Among
them were some of the oldest and best known citizens of the
eastern part of the State of Pennsylvania,&mdash;men whose lives
were a guaranty that they were above all petty influences and
vulgar prejudices,&mdash;who could safely take the oath prescribed by
law for a juror.</p>

<p>Eighty-one answered to their names. Several of the absent
had sent excuses, and nineteen of those present were released
either absolutely or temporarily on account of sickness or other
causes. Preliminary arrangements were made for reporting the
proceedings phonographically for the use of the Court and the
counsel. Some conversation was had as to the propriety of restraining
the publication of the testimony, &amp;c., of the trial in the
newspapers, for fear that, upon a second trial, an unprejudiced
panel of jurors could not be found. But no order was made by
the Court, and during the whole trial, the papers of this and the
adjoining cities contained full accounts of everything that transpired.
The District Attorney then gave notice that &#8220;as at
present advised, he would in the morning move for the arraignment
of Castner Hanway,&#8221;&mdash;and the Court adjourned for the
day.</p>

<p>On Tuesday morning, before ten o&#8217;clock, the Court room was
again filled. After a few more excuses of jurors had been heard,
the District Attorney for the United States, moved for the arraignment
of the defendant, Castner Hanway. Mr. John M. Read,
one of the counsel who afterwards appeared for the prisoner,
made some remarks in regard to the informality in the summoning
of the panel of jurors, and cited several cases to sustain
the objections which he informally made to the whole array.
The District Attorney in reply alleged that the return to the
<i>venire</i> was perfectly proper, but intimated that if the counsel for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
defence would move to quash the array, there would be no opposition
on the part of the Government. This was the first intimation
given to the public that the jurymen returned were unsatisfactory
to the prosecution. There had been rumors that the
District Attorney himself intended making a motion to quash,
but no official dissatisfaction had been previously known. To
such a proposition, however, the defendant could not agree. He
had been in a felon&#8217;s cell for more than two months, and his health
and strength were fast giving way to the confinement. He and
his friends had spared neither pains nor expense to procure the
attendance of witnesses, and were as well prepared then for trial
as they ever could be. Any panel of impartial men was all
he asked, and this he had no reason to doubt were then summoned,
as by law, he was entitled to have them. Yet to give
the Government as fair an opportunity as its officers desired,
another of his counsel, Mr. Thaddeus Stevens, offered to
make the motion to quash, on condition that the prisoner be
admitted to &#8220;<i>ample</i> bail,&#8221; and the trial be ordered to take
place in the county of Lancaster. The District Attorney refused
to agree to this, and the clerk read to the defendant the
Indictment.</p>

<p>This paper, containing five counts, charged him with wickedly
and traitorously intending to levy war upon the United States.
It embraced the usual amount of legal nonsense, and recited as
much of the transactions at Christiana on the morning of the
11th September, as were necessary.</p>

<p>After the reading had concluded, the clerk asked him&mdash;</p>

<p>How say you, Castner Hanway, are you guilty or not guilty?</p>

<p><i>Hanway.</i> Not guilty.</p>

<p><i>Clerk.</i> How will you be tried?</p>

<p><i>Hanway.</i> By God and my country.</p>

<p><i>Clerk.</i> God send you a good deliverance.</p>

<p>The counsel who appeared in his defence were: <span class="smcap">John M.
Read</span> of Philadelphia, <span class="smcap">Thaddeus Stevens</span> of Lancaster, <span class="smcap">Jos. J.
Lewis</span> of Westchester, <span class="smcap">Theodore Cuyler</span> of Philadelphia, and
<span class="smcap">W. Arthur Jackson</span>, ditto.</p>

<p>On behalf of the government were present: <span class="smcap">John W. Ashmead</span>,
District Attorney of the United States for the Eastern
District of Pennsylvania, <span class="smcap">Geo. L. Ashmead</span> of Philadelphia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
<span class="smcap">James R. Ludlow</span>, ditto; and in the phonographic report it is
stated that &#8220;the State of Maryland was represented by <span class="smcap">Robert
J. Brent</span>, <span class="smcap">James Cooper</span> and <span class="smcap">R. M. Lee</span>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Why such a statement should appear in the only report of the
case printed by authority is totally inexplicable. The government
of the United States had no right to admit the State of
Maryland as a party to the record. If Hanway had offended
against any State authority, it was against the State of Pennsylvania.
The statement, then, must be a mere <i>dictum</i> of the
reporter, and the entire array of counsel for the prosecution
must have been by <i>permission</i> of the United States government.</p>

<p>The counsel for each side having been formally recognized, the
clerk proceeded to call a jury. The government submitted a
series of six questions, which it was proposed to ask each juryman,
touching his competency to be sworn. The first related to
conscientious scruples on the subject of capital punishments&mdash;the
usual question put in capital cases; the second, third, fourth
and fifth asked, in different forms, whether the juror had formed
an opinion of the case; and the sixth asked his opinion of the Fugitive
Slave Law. After remarks from the counsel on both sides, they
were amended by the court, but not materially altered. The rest
of the day was spent in selecting jurors, and discussing matters
which arose from time to time upon their answers to the several
questions put to them.</p>

<p>The third day passed in the same way, Minor points were
raised by the counsel and decided by the court, but nothing of
general interest occurred. It was, however, by this time, evident
that the trial would occupy much time, and arrangements
for the accommodation of the jury, witnesses, &amp;c., were made
accordingly. By three o&#8217;clock, eleven jurors had been sworn,
as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
1. Robert Elliot, Perry county.<br />
2. James Wilson, Adams county.<br />
3. Thomas Connolly, Carbon county.<br />
4. Peter Martin, Lancaster county.<br />
5. Robert Smith, Adams county.<br />
6. William R. Saddler, Adams county.<br />
7. James N. Hopkins, Lancaster county.<br />
8. John Junkin, Perry county.<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>9. Solomon Newman, Pike county.<br />
10. Jonathan Wainwright, Philadelphia county.<br />
11. Ephraim Fenton, Montgomery county.<br />
</p></blockquote>

<p>The 12th, James Cowden, Lancaster county, was called but
not sworn at the time. The Court had determined to adjourn
over till Friday, Thursday being the day appointed by the
Governor of Pennsylvania as Thanksgiving day. As the rule
of law would have required the jury to remain together, after
the panel was complete, until a verdict was rendered or they
were discharged by the court, for their comfort, Mr. Cowden was
not sworn. They were allowed to separate, and his Honor,
Judge Kane, informed them that apartments had been provided
for them at the American Hotel, immediately opposite the courthouse,
where he would advise them to remove their wardrobe
during the interval.</p>

<p>On Friday morning, names of the witnesses for the Government
were called, the twelfth Juror was sworn and the Court
was ready to proceed with the trial.</p>

<p>It was known that the defendant was to be tried for Treason,
but how the acts he committed were to be construed into this
grave offence was a mystery which now was about to be developed.
He was to see the witnesses face to face, and hear them testify
in regard to the occurrences at Christiana. Public expectation
was anxiously awaiting the developments for the first time about
to be made. Vague rumors were to give place to proof, and a
precedent to be established that would settle many perplexing
questions which had arisen from sectional interpretations of the
Fugitive Slave Law of 1850.</p>

<p>Mr. Ashmead, the District Attorney, opened the cause in a
speech about an hour and a half long. Relying on information
he had received from the lips of witnesses examined in private,
he committed the common error of stating that some things would
be testified to, which were only heard of in these opening remarks.
He rehearsed the indictments, gave a short account of
the occurrences at Parker&#8217;s house, spoke of its being the result
of a combination of which he had evidence, and concluded by explaining
to the Jury the law of Treason, quoting at large from
the books. His remarks were given to the public through the
press, and being the first authentic publication from the trial,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
were generally read. It created the impression that Hanway
was guilty as he stood indicted&mdash;no one doubting that witnesses
would prove the exact statements made by the cautious District
Attorney.</p>

<p>When Mr. Ashmead had concluded his remarks, Z. Collins
Lee, Esq., the U. S. District Attorney for the District of Maryland,
appeared, and was recognized as one of the counsel for the
Government. The array of counsel for the prosecution then
comprised one U. S. Senator, one Attorney General of a sovereign
State, two U. S. District Attornies, one Recorder of the
city of Philadelphia and two members of the Philadelphia Bar,
who boasted of no official position. With such a combination it
was confidently expected that, as a matter of practice, aside from
the issues to be tried, the management of this cause would be a
model which the profession would be safe in imitating.</p>

<p>After proving the appointment of Mr. E. D. Ingraham as
Commissioner of the United States, Mr. Ingraham was called
and testified to the issuing of the warrants for the arrest of Noah
Buley, Nelson Ford, Joshua Hammond and George Hammond.</p>

<p>At this stage of the case Mr. J. M. Read asked that the witnesses
for the prosecution be kept out of the Court-Room during
the progress of the trial. Mr. Ashmead asked for the same
order as regarded the witnesses for the defendant. The Court,
admitting the propriety of both requests, granted them, and directed
the Marshal to provide suitable accommodations. There
being no objection on the part of the defence, the Rev. Mr.
Gorsuch, who had been subp&oelig;naed for the proof of some collateral
matter, was allowed to remain.</p>

<p>Drafts of Parker&#8217;s house and the fields around it were presented,
and their accuracy proven.</p>

<p>Henry H. Kline, the Deputy Marshal, who had attempted to
make the arrests, was next called. It was known that he was the
&#8220;leading witness&#8221; on the part of the prosecution. He had been
the leader of the U. S. forces in this contest; had taken an active
part in having the neighborhood of Christiana placed under arrest;
had declared martial law there; and had been the principal
witness at the examinations in Christiana and Lancaster.
His testimony was naturally looked for with some interest, as
well by those who knew the character of the man, as by those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
who had then heard of him for the first time. His evidence is
contained in 33 printed pages of the report published under the
auspices of the Court,&mdash;more than one tenth of the whole work.
It is not our purpose to speak of it at length; we have already
spoken of the facts as they occurred. The portion of his testimony
bearing most upon the cause, was his statement of the interview
with Hanway and Lewis at the bars. The jury were
informed of the <i>truth</i> of this matter before the trial was concluded,
by other witnesses.</p>

<p>During the examination of Kline the question of identity of
those present at the transaction came up, and the most of those
prisoners whom he had called by name were ordered to be brought
up to Court on the next (Saturday) morning. It is this which
gives Mr. Brent the offence of which he so loudly complains in
his printed report (p. 5) of the trial to Gov. Lowe. He comments
on the dress of the negroes, the manner in which they had combed
their hair, their position in the crowded court room, and of the
conduct of the officers having charge of the prisoners who thus
gave them &#8220;aid and comfort.&#8221;</p>

<p>In his zeal, Mr. Brent probably forgets what he must have
learned in his instructor&#8217;s office, that the Law presumes every
man innocent, and requires that he shall be treated with
every possible attention to his personal comfort, while confined
in prison awaiting trial upon any charge. He certainly must
remember the sumptuous mode of living allowed to Dr. Webster
in Boston, to the Knapps when charged with instigating the
murder of their uncle, and many other similar cases well known
to every Tyro in the profession.</p>

<p>Besides this presumption of law, the friends of every prisoner
must have free access to him until conviction. The jailer is only
responsible for his appearance at the proper time, and may permit
him any privileges, save liberty, to which he is entitled as
a free man. When these negroes were brought to the prison,
from Lancaster, they were dressed in their summer clothing.
Their wives and children were too poor to come to Philadelphia
to attend to their comforts. It is a strange cause of complaint
that they found persons humane enough to furnish them with
proper garments. A moment&#8217;s reflection would see the reason
why &#8220;their comforts and their clothes should be, in every respect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
alike.&#8221; The supply was probably furnished from the
<i>same</i> store, at the <i>same</i> time, and for the <i>same</i> purpose. Instead
of being a reproach, it is an honor to our city, that persons were
found who were unwilling to permit these creatures to suffer for
the want of those comforts which are not furnished at the public
expense; and were Mr. Brent better acquainted with our citizens,
he would see the same thing done in many other cases, in
which humanity could not be construed into &#8220;bullying and bravado&#8221;
of such a Government as that of which we are all proud.</p>

<p>On the morning on which the prisoners were brought into
Court, Mr. Read represented to the Court the effect confinement
had on Hanway&#8217;s health; and the Court instructed the Marshal,
that when thus suffering, the authorities had &#8220;no right, if he
can be safely kept otherwise, to keep him in a manner injurious
to his health. If the Marshal can give this prisoner better
lodging, feeling certain he can keep him safely, we have no objection
to any indulgence of that nature, and direct the Marshal
to grant it to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>After Kline had concluded, Dr. Thomas Pierce was called.
His testimony embraces about thirteen pages of the paper book.
He repeated substantially the evidence of the Marshal. Mr. J.
M. Gorsuch was next called. His story was clear and consistent
throughout. Mr. Dickinson Gorsuch followed him. These two
gentlemen being one a nephew, the other a son of Mr. Edward
Gorsuch, were not cross-examined by the defence. Messrs. H.
Hutchings and N. Nelson were next called.</p>

<p>These witnesses had all accompanied Kline to Parker&#8217;s house,
and testified to the occurrences there. The remainder were
called to prove what transpired after the attempt to make the
arrests had been abandoned, or to other circumstances deemed
necessary by the prosecution to make out their case. After
Miller and John Nott had been examined, the Court adjourned.</p>

<p>On Monday morning, after the excuses of several jurymen had
been heard, and an order made for the alleviation of the condition
of Collister Wilson, one of the prisoners awaiting trial, the
cause was resumed by recalling Miller and John Nott. The
array of counsel had, on Saturday, neglected to elicit something
that had been, &#8220;upon consultation,&#8221; deemed of importance.
The examination was resumed, and continued at length upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
minor points, until the Court, at the instance of defendant&#8217;s
counsel, stopped the repetition.</p>

<p>Alderman Reigart and Wm. Proudfoot, constable of Sadsbury
township, testified to the conduct of Hanway and Lewis, when
bullied by Kline at the house of Frederick Zerker, where they
had surrendered themselves to the officers. The object of this
was to show, that their silence was tantamount to a confession.
Alderman Reigart testified to having come down from
Lancaster with a <i>posse</i> of one hundred and fifty men to make
arrests.</p>

<p>Charles Smith was offered for the purpose of proving that
notice of the intended arrest had been given to Hanway and
others, by Samuel Williams. The evidence was objected to, the
question argued at length, and the objection overruled by the
Court. Smith then testified merely to the fact, that Williams
had given notice to him, but did not know the same had been
given to Hanway.</p>

<p>Dr. Cain testified to nearly the same facts, and, in addition,
to his attendance upon an annual meeting of the Anti-Slavery
Society of Pennsylvania, in West Chester, some time previously.
This was the only attempt made to sustain the allegations
of the opening speech of the District Attorney, in regard
to combination for the purpose of resisting the Fugitive Slave
Law. Two colored men, John Roberts and Samuel Hanson,
were next placed upon the stand. Towards the end of Hanson&#8217;s
testimony, a discussion arose upon a point of evidence, in which
Messrs. Brent and Read took part. Their remarks were diverted
somewhat from the purpose; and Mr. Brent took occasion to explain
his position in the case, though, at that time, his position
had not been assailed. He asserted his right arose by reason of
an invitation from the Federal authorities, though, he said, he
came by authority of the Executive of Maryland. Altogether,
his attempt to define his position totally failed; and the public
would have understood the matter quite as well, if, according to
the rule, no answer had been made to the concluding remarks of
the defendant&#8217;s counsel.</p>

<p>Jacob Wood testified that Elijah Lewis had called him from his
work that morning, telling him that kidnappers were at Parker&#8217;s
house. Mr. D. Gorsuch then identified the coat his father wore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
on the morning of the attempt to arrest; and to the surprise of
every one, the case of the United States was announced to be
concluded.</p>

<p>Seldom do there occur like discrepancies between an opening
speech and evidence offered to sustain it. Those observers
who, relying upon the loose statements of the public journals,
really believed treason had been committed, and, without any
personal feeling towards the particular defendants, hoped for a
conviction, were sadly disappointed. The general public were
astonished that so much smoke had arisen from so small a fire,
and wondered what could be the reason. While the friends of
Hanway and his colleagues, knowing from the first the exact
truth, were gratified that the <i>denouement</i> was in precise conformity
with what they had foreseen <i>must</i> be the result of this mockery
of justice.</p>

<p>The Court adjourned earlier than usual, both to give counsel
an opportunity of consultation, and to await the return of
Messrs. Cooper and Stevens, who were absent at Washington,
where they had gone to be present at the opening of the thirty-second
Congress.</p>

<p>The next morning, Tuesday, Mr. Cuyler opened for the
defence. After expressing his surprise at the insufficiency of
the testimony offered to prove what had been threatened, he
commented on the strange and unprecedented array of counsel
in the case for the Government. He spoke of the fidelity of the
State of Pennsylvania to the Constitution, and for himself and
colleagues endorsed the eulogistic remarks of the opposite side,
upon the value of the Union. The defendant, he said, did not
come to justify the transactions at Christiana, but to say that
&#8220;he was in no way a party to those outrages.&#8221; He was a native
of Delaware, had, at five years of age, removed with his father
to Chester county, Pa. After living there for several years he
had resided in Maryland, and afterwards in one of the Western
States. About three years previous to the trial he had returned
to Chester county, and in 1850 married and settled in Lancaster
county, near Christiana. Mr. Cuyler then mentioned two cases
of kidnapping which had occurred in Lancaster county, and spoke
of the natural feeling in the neighborhood in regard to such outrages.
He then detailed the occurrences of the morning of the
eleventh of September, stated that it would be proved that Hanway<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
had been told there were &#8220;kidnappers at Parker&#8217;s house,&#8221;
that it was this which carried him there; that it was owing to
his and Lewis&#8217; exertions that more blood was not shed; and that,
by throwing himself between the negroes and their pursuers,
Hanway had saved the life of Dr. Thomas Pierce. He then
stated that he would show by &#8220;ample proof the notorious bad
name of Kline for truth;&#8221; and closed his remarks with his view
of the Law of Treason, quoting at length from many acknowledged
authorities.</p>

<p>Thomas Pennington was then called, to testify to the &#8220;kidnapping
and carrying away of colored persons, in the neighborhood
of the Gap, within the last year.&#8221;</p>

<p>The testimony was objected to, and a long argument ensued.
The Court ruled that it was important, as bearing upon the
question of intention, and must be admitted. The witness then
stated, that in January, 1851, just after nightfall, two men
entered his house, presented a pistol at the head of a colored
man, who lived with him, and threatened to blow his brains out
if he resisted. Other men followed, bound the black man, dragged
him off, placed him in a carriage, in waiting, and hurried
him away. Henry Ray, Rachel Chamberlin and Miller Pennington
testified to the same facts.</p>

<p>Elijah Lewis was next called to the stand. In the absence of
Mr. Ashmead, who it appeared had determined to object to the
witness, Mr. Brent made the objections, on the ground that he
was interested in the issue of the trial,&mdash;i. e. if his testimony
should procure an acquittal of Hanway, would this not enure to
the acquittal of Lewis on the joint indictments against them, as
Hanway could not be tried a second time? The objection was
overruled by the Court, and the witness admitted. He was then
carefully examined and cross-examined, and gave an account of
the transaction, from the time he was first told that &#8220;there were
kidnappers at Parker&#8217;s house,&#8221; until he delivered himself into
custody.</p>

<p>Henry Burt, who lived with Castner Hanway during September,
1851, was next called. He testified to Lewis&#8217; having told
Hanway that there were kidnappers at Parker&#8217;s house. While
Hanway was eating his breakfast, he saddled the horse. After
the affray he saw Kline, and had some conversation with him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>Jacob Whitson testified that Kline, three days after the riot,
came to his father&#8217;s house in search of Parker, who he said had
shot Edward Gorsuch.</p>

<p>When the Court sat the next morning, Mr. R. M. Lee, considering
himself misrepresented by Mr. Cuyler, in his remarks
the day previous, explained the position he occupied in the case.
The subject of counsel seemed to be a painful one to most of
the gentlemen engaged on the part of the prosecution, and no
opportunity was lost to explain to the public the relative position
occupied by each. Mr. Cuyler, of course, when he heard that
&#8220;the gentleman did not occupy the position of a volunteer,
withdrew his remarks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thompson Loughead was then examined as to the occurrences
of the morning; Samuel H. Laughlin as to conversations with
Kline; Isaac Rogers, who lived within a few hundred yards of
Parker&#8217;s house, as to the occurrences of the morning; and John
C. Dickinson in relation to conversations with Dr. T. G. Pierce,
after the transaction. Dr. Patterson and J. G. Henderson also
testified to statements made by Dr. Pierce in relation to the
occurrences of the morning.</p>

<p>Hon. W. D. Kelly, one of the Associate Judges of the Court of
Common Pleas, for the City and County of Philadelphia, Francis
Jobson, (collector of water rents,) Wm. D. Francke, Daniel
Evans, (fire-proof chest maker,) Isaiah G. Stratton, Wm. Stroud,
(officer in the Custom House,) Jacob Walker, John Hinkle, Norman
Ackley, (constable,) Anthony Hoover, Aaron B. Fithian,
Geo. K. Wise, John Mackey, Andrew Redheffer, John McEwen,
Thomas Liston, William Hopkins, James Smith, William Nutt,
John Manderson, Jacob Glassmire, John Dittus, Joseph Parker,
Charles H. Roberts,<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a> testified that they knew Henry H. Kline.
They were citizens of Philadelphia, and some of them had been
acquainted with him for twelve or fourteen years. When asked
the question prescribed by law, &#8220;What is his general character
for truth and veracity?&#8221; the answer uniformly was, &#8220;It is bad,&#8221;
or words to that effect. Some, and among these Judge Kelly,
when asked, &#8220;Would you believe him on his oath?&#8221; answered,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
&#8220;That would depend on circumstances;&#8221; some answered positively
&#8220;no,&#8221; and others so qualified their answers as to show
their belief that his testimony should be received cautiously.</p>

<p>John Carr, a blacksmith, who lived four or five miles from
Parker&#8217;s, testified that on the night of the 10th of September,
between eight and nine o&#8217;clock, he followed Harvey Scott (one
of the colored men whom Kline swore he saw at Parker&#8217;s) up
stairs to bed, in the garret of his house, and buttoned the door
after him; the next morning (the 11th) he unbuttoned the same
door, called him down, saw him immediately go about his daily
employment, and had him employed that day in his shop. John
S. Cochran, who also lived with John Carr, testified to substantially
the same facts.</p>

<p>Lewis Cooper was examined as to the transactions of the
morning of the 11th, after the riot. He carried from the ground,
in his dearborn, the wounded Dickinson Gorsuch, and the body
of Edward Gorsuch. He testified to some conversations with
several witnesses, and that he was one of the neighbors who
accompanied the corpse to Maryland.</p>

<p>John Houston was called, and testified that about the time of
the riot there was a party of men at work on the railroad near
Christiana, who were called to work in the morning by a bugle;
and to some other immaterial matters.</p>

<p>Enoch Harlan, Joseph M. Thompson, George Mitchell, Levi
Wayne Thompson, Andrew Mitchell, Wharton Pennock, Samuel
Pennock, John Bernard, Calvin Russell, Isaac Walton, James
Coates, Ellis P. Irvin, Geo. W. Irwin, testified that they knew
the defendant Hanway, some of them having known him from
boyhood. They all represented him as an &#8220;orderly, quiet, well-disposed
and peaceable citizen.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this the testimony on the part of the defendant closed.
They had proven all they promised&mdash;the notoriously bad character
of Kline for truth and veracity, the good character of
Hanway, the acts of kidnapping, and such other circumstances
as repelled the presumption of combination; but most important
of all, the fact that Hanway went suddenly to Parker&#8217;s house,
upon information that there were kidnappers around it, to prevent
if possible the recurrence of such scenes as had more than
once appalled the neighborhood; that when shown the legal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
authority of the officer, he was going away, and only delayed his
departure from the ground to use his exertions in preventing
bloodshed.</p>

<p>The prosecution, in turn, offered rebutting testimony. Mr. G.
L. Ashmead, in his opening remarks, offered to sustain the character
of Kline, which, it seems, was thought to have been
somewhat damaged by the attack made upon it; to prove (if the
attendance of witnesses could be procured) that the seizure from
the house of Chamberlain was not a case of kidnapping; that
in September, 1850, armed bands of negroes paraded the
&#8220;streets of Lancaster&#8221; (city) in search of slave-hunters; that
in April, 1851, a Mr. Samuel Worthington had been prevented
from making arrest of an alleged fugitive from labor, in the
vicinity of Christiana; to contradict some witnesses who had
related conversations with Kline; to prove that Harvey Scott
was at Parker&#8217;s house, by the testimony of Scott himself; to
prove that after the riot Kline had acted as a good officer; and
that sundry meetings had been held in Lancaster county in favor
of the &#8220;higher law.&#8221;</p>

Dr. Vondersmith, Alderman White, Charles P. Buckingham,
Phillip Winnemore, J. C. Smith, George Carter, J. P. Loughead,
(attorney,) were called to support Kline&#8217;s character. Many of
them said, they had heard his character called in question, but
that they would believe him on his oath.</p>

<p>William Noble was next called, to prove that &#8220;in the month of
September, 1851, the county of Lancaster, and particularly the
neighborhood of Christiana, was patrolled by armed bodies of
negroes, after a report that slaveholders had come up there for
slaves. That these armed bands of negroes went from house to
house, in that neighborhood, searching for the slaveholders,
swearing vengeance against them, and expressing a determination
to kill them.&#8221;</p>

<p>The object of this was to sustain the allegation of combination&mdash;the
gist of the entire case, in the proof of which the prosecution
had so signally failed.</p>

<p>To this extraordinary offer, Mr. Read, on behalf of the defence,
objected on several grounds. The evidence was in chief, and not
rebutting testimony. It was the bounden duty of the prosecution,
as well by the rules of evidence as in mercy to the defendants, to
have offered it before the close of their case. Besides this, the
Act of Congress requires that the United States shall furnish,
three days before a trial for treason, the names of those witnesses
whom they intend to examine touching the charges against the
prisoner.</p>

<p>Mr. G. L. Ashmead and Mr. Brent both replied, asserting
that the existence of this testimony was not known to them at
the commencement of the trial; and arguing that this was rebutting
testimony; they could find no part of the defendant&#8217;s case
which it could be considered as rebutting, except the opening
remarks of counsel.</p>

<p>Both members of the Court decided the evidence offered to be
in chief, and sustained the objections of Mr. Read.</p>

<p>Samuel Worthington was next offered, to prove that some time
in 1851, he and a party of men went to the neighborhood of
Christiana, in search of a fugitive slave, and stopped at the
house of a man by the name of Haines; that &#8220;immediately the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
same signals were given at that house as at Parker&#8217;s;&#8221; and to
show by this that &#8220;the motive which actuated Hanway and
others was not of a lawful and legal character, but of a treasonable
and criminal kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>The same objections were made as before to Noble&#8217;s testimony,
and the defence again expressed their disapprobation of giving
evidence to rebut lawyers&#8217; speeches.</p>

<p>The Court overruled the offer, on the same grounds as had
rejected Noble&#8217;s testimony, and the witness was withdrawn.</p>

<p>Cist Cockney was next examined, to contradict Jacob Whitson,
who had testified in regard to conversations of Kline. John
Bacon testified to a difficulty between Kline and some officers at
Christiana.</p>

<p>Harvey Scott was called &#8220;to prove that the testimony given
by Carr and others&mdash;the alibi&mdash;is not correct; that he was on
the ground, and to explain how he got out of the room and proceeded
to the scene of action.&#8221; After some conversation the
question was asked, &#8220;Were you at the battle on the morning of
the 11th September last?&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> I gave my evidence that I was there, once. I was
frightened at the time I was taken up, and I said I was there,
but I was not.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i> Were you there on the morning of the 11th September
last?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> I was proved to be there, but I was not there.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i> On the morning of the 11th September last?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i> No sir. Kline swore I was there, and at the time I
was taken up I told the man I was not there; and they took me
to Christiana, and I was frightened, and I didn&#8217;t know what to
say, and I said what they told me.</p>

<p>The witness was not cross-examined, but, after a threat to
prosecute for perjury, was discharged.</p>

<p>The next morning (Dec. 2) an informal conversation took
place in regard to the evidence of Scott. In answer to all the
imputations of tampering, made by the prosecution and others,
it is sufficient to say, that from the time of his arrest till the
examination on the first of December, he was confined in the
debtors&#8217; apartment of the Moyamensing Prison, in custody of the
U. S. officers, and beyond the reach of any person, except such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
as went there on behalf of the prosecution. Like all liars, when
left to himself and his own reflections, he concluded it was best
to tell the whole truth, especially when this exculpated him from
the difficulty into which his own folly and weakness had plunged
him. It had been proved, beyond a doubt, that Scott was <i>not</i>
within three miles of Parker&#8217;s house on the morning of the 11th,
and his declarations made that morning to witnesses who were
examined, proved that he was capable of telling the truth, when
uninfluenced by fear. As soon as arrested, he was threatened
with imprisonment and death; but at first he told a consistent
story. Soon the coward&#8217;s hope induced him to make false statements.
Ignorant, and not gifted with the ordinary intelligence
belonging to persons of his condition in life, he knew not the
nature and obligation of an oath, and swore as he believed would
be acceptable to those whom he supposed to have power over his
liberty, and perhaps his life. From the time of the preliminary
examinations until brought upon the stand, he was in the care
and keeping of the agents of the prosecution; and, as appears
by the statements made at the time of his examination, he had
been visited in his cell, after the testimony for the prosecution
had closed, by some of the counsel for the prosecution, and there
told the story which they believed he would repeat under oath.
They had their manifest reasons for not calling upon him to give
evidence in chief, since they did not dare to do so, even in rebuttal,
till he had been visited in prison, and the probable nature
of his testimony ascertained!</p>

<p>It was also said, that the day before his examination &#8220;he was
conversed with by several negroes, in the Marshal&#8217;s office, who
had to be sent away from him.&#8221; This may account for his finally
telling the truth. It is certain, that in such a place no one had
an opportunity of quite so full a conversation with him as could
have been held in his cell at Moyamensing prison. But the
<i>sight</i> of his former comrades was sufficient to compel him to
exercise even the small amount of conscience which nature had
bestowed upon him. But if it were granted, for the sake of argument,
that &#8220;some negroes&#8221; had a conversation with him, by
what rule of right or principle of law, could they be condemned
for entreating the unhappy man not to degrade himself by committing
the loathsome crime of perjury? Mr. Brent&#8217;s pamphlet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
implies the existence of such a code of morals; but if it exist at
all, its influence must be confined to the borders of the State he
represented.</p>

<p>Dr. Pierce was recalled, to refute the charges of cowardice,
which it was said he had, in conversation, made against Kline;
and Dickinson Gorsuch, to testify that he saw two of his father&#8217;s
slaves at Parker&#8217;s house.</p>

<p>With this the examination of witnesses closed. Nothing was
wanting to complete the trial but the arguments of counsel, the
charge of the Judge and the verdict. Those who had attentively
watched the testimony, plainly saw that the attempt to sustain
the charge of Treason was a failure. The counsel for the prosecution,
if rumor is to be depended upon, had for several days
abandoned all hopes of a conviction. There were many persons,
however, who believed the jury would not be able to agree upon
a verdict. Public excitement had subsided, and towards the close
of the examination of witnesses, the court room comfortably
seated all who chose to assemble to hear the proceedings. The
desire to hear the speeches again drew a crowd, and expectation
was raised to the highest pitch in regard to one of the counsel,
who, when his turn came, considered that it was not necessary for
the interest of his client to occupy the time of the Court.</p>

<p>After some preliminary arrangements, Mr. Ludlow began his
remarks to the jury and occupied the remainder of the day. He
commenced by hastily repeating the part Hanway had taken in
the transactions of the morning of the 11th of September. Then
citing the 3d Section of Article III of the Constitution of the
United States, and the decisions of all courts upon it, argued
that the acts committed came within the provisions of the Law.
He said that &#8220;taking the whole transaction together, this man
Hanway, if guilty at all, is guilty by virtue of his presence upon
the ground and joining with the conspirators, the whole transaction
being the overt act.&#8221; His conduct, Mr. L., thought, was
not that of an innocent man; but that it confirmed the hypothesis
of guilty intent before going to Parker&#8217;s. The conflict of testimony
to this point, must, he thought, be decided in favor of the Government&#8217;s
witnesses. Elijah Lewis&#8217;s evidence, he told the Jury, must
be weighed with the utmost caution. Without attributing perjury
to him, it was suggested &#8220;that he would shape his course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
so as to swear his friend who was the leader, he being the
lieutenant, out of the difficulty, and his friend would come and
swear him out in turn.&#8221;</p>

<p>The alleged case of kidnapping, he said, was committed by a
party of imprudent Southerners, who, under the decision of the
Supreme Court in Prigg&#8217;s case, had taken the law in their own
hands and carried their slave away without process. He argued,
too, that Hanway&#8217;s good character could not avail him in such a
prosecution. The testimony in regard to Kline&#8217;s bad character
was, he thought, the result of opposition to the Fugitive Slave
Law, and was more than met by the witnesses who had been
produced in rebuttal. He then defended Kline from the imputation
of cowardice, which it appeared rested upon him, from
his conduct at Parker&#8217;s house, and contended he had acted as a
good officer and brave man. Mr. L. then pointed out and attempted
to reconcile to the Jury some discrepancies in the
evidence, and concluded by some eloquent remarks upon the
value and importance of the Union.</p>

<p>The next morning, (Saturday December 6th,) before the argument
was resumed, Mr. Brent called the attention of the court
to an article in a paper called the Pennsylvania Freeman. It
contained an account of the serving up of a dinner for the
prisoners on Thanksgiving day, and stated that the Marshal had
participated with them. After some rather severe remarks from
the Bench upon the character of the paper, the Marshal made
an explanation of the matter with which Mr. Brent expressed
himself perfectly satisfied.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the object of presenting the subject
to the Court at that time, whether to &#8220;give a public officer an
opportunity of offering a public explanation,&#8221; or for any other
purpose, it certainly had the effect of casting odium upon the
prisoner at the bar. It was extraneous matter and as such
should have been withheld till the conclusion of the trial. But
when offered, the defence did not choose to exercise their right
to object, not wishing to prejudice the defendant by any act
which, on the part of illiberal counsel, might be called a disposition
to stifle a full and fair investigation, of what (had not its
folly and absurdity been made public) might, by <i>innuendo</i> and
such other tricks, have been handled before the Jury in a manner
prejudicial to the defendant.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>Mr. Lewis then began his remarks in behalf of the defence.
He deprecated, in strong terms, the whole prosecution, and alleged
it had been commenced in a moment of excitement and public
phrenzy. Had a little time been allowed for reflection, for inquiry
into the facts, to ascertain Castner Hanway&#8217;s character,
this issue would never have been presented to this jury. He
suggested that the whole proceeding had taken this course at
the instigation of the authorities of a neighboring State. The
people of Pennsylvania did not deserve such treatment. They
had always been loyal, and no better evidence of this is needed
than the course and character of their legislation. Mr. Lewis
then hastily rehearsed the different acts of Assembly upon the
subject, mentioning the objects and purposes of each, and in some
cases their private history. From these it appeared that the
State of Pennsylvania had ever attempted to establish two points:
&#8220;To provide a means for the recovery of fugitives within her
borders, and to protect her own free black population. The first
she did from comity, the last from duty.&#8221; The course of Maryland,
had, he remarked, been uniformly the opposite of this. She
had treated the free black subjects of Pennsylvania with habitual
harshness and severity. After further comments upon the relative
course of the two States, and asserting the right of every
citizen of Pennsylvania, to interpose his influence when injury
to her people or violence to her laws is threatened, he repeated
the remark made by one of his colleagues that no one deprecated
the unfortunate occurrences on the morning of the 11th more
than Castner Hanway, and that neither he nor his counsel came
there to justify, excuse, or palliate them. In their management
of the defence they had desired to obtain not only justice to the
living, but to observe a due respect to the memory of the dead,
and a regard for the lacerated feelings of those who were bound
by near ties to the unfortunate murdered man. The Messrs.
Gorsuch had not been asked a question in cross examination,
but were permitted to tell their story as witnesses in their own
way.</p>

<p>He then referred to the case of alleged kidnapping at Chamberlain&#8217;s,
and the feeling in the neighborhood which grew out of it.
While this feeling existed, Kline, after having spent a day and
two nights in the neighborhood, hanging about taverns and exhibiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
himself abroad at unusual hours, made his descent upon
the family of Parker under cover of the night. The whole affair
had a kidnapping aspect. &#8220;The persons that saw this company
of armed men surrounding this house of a negro supposed
to be free, and held at bay by those within, might well suspect
them to be kidnappers.&#8221; He reviewed carefully the whole
evidence, and by the circumstances proven, argued the absence
of combination, which must be sustained by two witnesses. Every
act of Hanway&#8217;s could be explained and was explained by attributing
to him humane and philanthropic motives. Any other construction
was forced and unsupported by testimony. &#8220;Instead
of being guilty of treason, there is no reasonable ground for imputing
even impropriety to him. Never indeed was such a prosecution
founded upon evidence so meagre, or such a charge
seriously made, that would be so foolish if it were not that the
subject is so serious.&#8221; Mr. L. then commented upon the law of
treason, and in a masterly argument occupying seven pages of
the printed report, fully elucidated to the jury the legal theory
on the subject.</p>

<p>Mr. Brent followed Mr. Lewis. He began his remarks by
reference to the oft-mooted question of counsel for the prosecution.
He and Mr. Cooper were there by authority of the general
Government, and he complained of the statements which had
been made in the public prints and elsewhere of the difficulties
which had arisen in their own camp. He said &#8220;there was an
unfortunate question of etiquette between the learned gentleman
(Mr. J. W. Ashmead,) and myself (Mr. Brent,) which upon my
arrival in the city was fairly and honorably adjusted between us.&#8221;</p>

<p>The State of Maryland could not take the reports of the trials
from the public newspapers. This man might be acquitted honorably,
yet <i>she</i> would not know it or <i>believe</i> it, and his duty was to
inform the citizens of Maryland officially of what had taken
place. They did not, as had been stated, thirst for blood; and
he complained at length of the insults that had been offered
him and his State, by those counsel for the defence, who had
animadverted upon the extraordinary array of counsel for
the prosecution. He then, &#8220;before discussing the legal merits
of the question at issue, attempted to depict the condition of the
South,&#8221; and went into an elaborate history of the Fugitive Slave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
Law, with an enumeration of the rights and privileges guarantied
by its provisions to slaveholders. After this, he spoke of the
Union, and the duties of each citizen towards his Government.</p>

<p>He then passed to what he called, &#8220;the powerful combination
of crushing testimony (corroborating Kline in every particular,)&#8221;
and promised to prove from it that Hanway &#8220;did then and there
connect himself with an organized band, which had been formed
for treason.&#8221; He argued that &#8220;there was overwhelming circumstantial
evidence to demonstrate Hanway&#8217;s implication in the
previous conspiracy.&#8221; There was no direct proof, nor was it
expected this could be brought &#8220;from a region the whole of
which is infected, and where every white man in that immediate
neighborhood, (with the exception of Miller Nott) <i>is leagued with
the traitors</i>.&#8221; From Hanway&#8217;s presence, his silence, and all he
was proved to have done, Mr. B. added it &#8220;was passing human
credulity to say that you cannot infer in all this, a feeling of hostility
to the law, and an intention to resist it.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>

<p>The hour for adjournment having arrived, Mr. Brent suspended
his remarks.</p>

<p>On Monday morning (Dec. 8th,) at the usual hour, he resumed
by answering the comments Mr. Lewis had made upon the laws
of Maryland, in relation to free colored persons coming into that
State; and spoke of the evils that would result from a dissolution
of the Union, and the execration in which those persons should be
held who preached treason in the streets and from the pulpits.</p>

<p>He expressed surprise that Hanway&#8217;s wife had been permitted
to remain by his side during the trial, and warned the Jury not to
be moved by her tears. &#8220;There are other strange things,&#8221; he
continued, &#8220;that have occurred in the progress of this trial,&#8221; and
he mentioned the escape of prisoners, and the refusal of Harvey
Scott to commit perjury a third time. The conduct of Elijah
Lewis, Joseph Scarlet, Hanway, Dr. Kane and Lewis Cooper, on
the day of the attack on Parker&#8217;s house, was next reviewed, in the
severest terms; and then, after speaking of the evidence, he justified
the conduct of Kline. He defended the Southern States<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
from the charge of cruelty towards slaves, and enumerated some
of the laws upon the subject.</p>

<p>The law of Treason was next considered, and he presented his
views at length to the Jury. In conclusion, he repeated that
the &#8220;State of Maryland did not thirst for innocent blood. She
thirsted only for the pure undefiled fountains of Justice. She
stood there for her rights, and stood undaunted.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Read, the senior counsel for the defence, followed in an
elaborate and searching argument. No part of the case was left
untouched. The only report of his remarks to which we have access,
is very meagre, not as full as that of the latter part of Mr. Brent&#8217;s
speech. He alluded in opening to the monstrous doctrine that
the Constitution allowed a master the right of seizing his slave
wherever found, without even offering to establish his identity,
as had been alleged to be the Law by those who had commented
upon the case of kidnapping from Chamberlain&#8217;s house. Prosecutions
and abuse for not sanctioning such outrages as these,
were equivalent to saying, &#8220;if you do not turn negro catcher,
we will indict you for treason.&#8221;</p>

<p>He continued with a rapid and striking sketch of English history,
throughout the period from which the cases relied upon by
the prosecution had been selected,&mdash;reviewing it reign by reign,
showing with great force the barbarous and tyrannical character
of the times, whose principles it was attempted to write into the
Constitution of America in the nineteenth century. Having laid
this general foundation, he proceeded to discuss at length each
particular case that had been cited; and not confining himself to
the mere face of the report, he searched out the facts from an
array of collateral authorities, such as was probably never before
submitted to any Court in any State trial, exhibiting the state of
parties, the influences at work upon the Bench and the Juries,
the character of the Judges, and the real value which ought to be
attached to their decisions. Coming down to the later periods
of English Jurisprudence, he insisted that even their Courts had
abandoned these principles, and would not now listen to the authorities
which the prosecution had attempted to enforce in Republican
America; and showed conclusively that at the present
day in England, no man could be convicted of treason in levying
war, unless an open insurrection or rebellion were actually raging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
in the land, and aiming at the change or destruction of the
Government. Passing next to the American decisions, he argued,
that stripped of the improper phraseology in which some of
them had been clothed, they established the same doctrine, and
that when this phraseology appeared to cover wider grounds, it had
been derived from earlier English cases, which at the time of
making the decisions were supposed by our Judges to be the
actually existing law of England, our lawyers then not having
the means of exposing their utter worthlessness.</p>

<p>Having established the general rule above stated as the result
of the decisions now in force, Mr. Read passed to an analysis of
the facts of the case; showing in the first place how utterly preposterous
was the attempt to dignify this miserable riot with the
name of insurrection and rebellion, and that looking at it in its
true light, Hanway was not and could not have been a participator.
The only overt act he committed, consisted in giving insolent
replies to Kline, and the evidence of this was wholly uncorroborated,
depending entirely on Kline&#8217;s credibility. &#8220;A man morally
and physically deaf, comes here and says he heard the defendant
<i>whisper</i> to the colored men the words, &#8216;shoot at them.&#8217; A
perjured man who don&#8217;t hear and can&#8217;t hear, is brought into this
court to convict an innocent man, whose hands are white&mdash;not
red with the blood of his fellow man.&#8221;</p>

<p>From the contradictions in Kline&#8217;s own testimony, and the
opposing evidence, both of the government and the defence, he
showed beyond a doubt the perjury of this essential witness; that
he was not and could not have been near the bars at the time of
the firing, but almost half a mile away in the woods. As this
single point was absolutely fatal to the case of the prosecution,
he thought it useless to expend time on minor and immaterial
details.</p>

<p>After reviewing the testimony of the prosecution, he passed to
that of the defence, and showed wherein it supplied the defects
of the Government&#8217;s case. He commented upon the conduct of
Harvey Scott, &#8220;who had been tutored to tell a story, and who
was frightened into it by Marshal Kline.&#8221;</p>

<p>The unfortunate termination of the attempt to arrest the slaves
of Mr. Gorsuch, was owing to the imbecile and foolish conduct of
Kline. &#8220;He had prowled up and down a peaceful country,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
drinking and carousing, and blustering about horse thieves, until
all the slaves had notice of his coming. Had the Chief Marshal
of this Court been sent, instead of this prating villain, all the
slaves within reach might have been arrested without loss of
blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>The conclusion of his remarks, was an interesting summary of
the laws enacted in the Southern States for the government of
the slaves, exhibiting at length their real position, and the real
relations existing between them and their masters.</p>

<p>The object of this concluding part of his argument, was to show
that a riot, which in a free State was a mere temporary ebullition,
might in the South be a matter of much more serious
moment, intimately affecting the lives and property of the masters;
but that we could not be required to transplant Southern
notions, resulting from a peculiar institution, into Northern law
and Northern Courts.</p>

<p>We have never seen a miscellaneous audience listen with such
earnest attention to a purely legal argument, as did the concourse
that thronged the Court room, to the strictly technical
part of Mr. Read&#8217;s speech.</p>

<p>After Mr. Read had concluded, according to the arrangements
agreed upon, Mr. Stevens was to speak. Many persons had
assembled to hear his remarks, and public expectation had been
excited to an unusual degree. The disappointment was general,
when he announced that he thought the case had been so fully
and ably argued, on the part of the defence, that his duty to the
defendant did not require him to add anything to what had
already been said.</p>

<p>Mr. Cooper closed the case for the Government.<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> In the
portion of it reported, he reviews the testimony of both sides,
and presented his interpretation of the contested points to the
jury, answering some of the arguments made by gentlemen for
the defence. The time at which his remarks were made compelled
him to go over much ground a second time. He concluded
by giving his views of the law of treason.</p>

<p>The abstract of the remarks of the different gentlemen engaged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
in the cause, is necessarily very crude and imperfect. No
attempt has been made to give anything more than a hasty
analysis of those parts of each speech that pertained to the case.</p>

<p>His Honor Judge Grier charged the jury, at length, upon the
law which should govern them in coming to a verdict.</p>

<p>The consideration of the case, he said, had occupied much
time, but not more than the importance of the issue, both as
respects the interests of the public, and duty to the prisoner
necessarily required. The Court had given ample time and
opportunity for the investigation of the law and the facts bearing
on the case,&mdash;not only because it is the first of a numerous list
of cases, of the same description, which involve the issue of life
and death to the parties immediately concerned, but because we
know the public eye is fixed upon us, and demands the unprejudiced
and impartial performance of the solemn duties we are
called upon to execute. The public and the prisoner have a right
to demand of you a firm, a fearless, and an unflinching performance
of your duty, and that the verdict you shall render shall be
a <i>true</i> verdict, according to the evidence which you have heard,
and the law as explained to you by the Court.</p>

<p>After some general remarks, not material to the point at issue,
he read the important parts of the indictment, the truth of whose
allegations the jury had been sworn to try.</p>

<p>The learned Judge then called attention to the facts in the
case that were undisputed. After these he added, &#8220;Two questions
present themselves for your inquiry:</p>

<p>&#8220;1. Was the defendant, Castner Hanway, a participant in the
offences proved to have been committed? Did he aid, abet, or
assist the negroes in this transaction, without regard to the grade
or description of the offence committed?</p>

<p>&#8220;2. And secondly, if he did, was the offence treason against
the United States, as alleged in the bill of indictment?</p>

<p>&#8220;The first of these questions is one wholly of fact, and for
your decision alone. The last is a mixed question of law and
fact. On the law you have a right to look to the Court for a
correct definition of what constitutes treason, but whether the
defendant has committed an offence which comes within that
category, is, of course, a matter of fact for your decision.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the present case the defendant was present, as proved by
several witnesses, and not denied. Did he come to aid, abet, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
countenance or encourage the rioters? If so, he was guilty of
every act committed by any individual engaged in the riot&mdash;whether
it amounts to felony or treason. There is no evidence
of any previous connexion of the prisoner with this party, before
the time the offence was committed; that he counselled, advised,
or exhorted the negroes to come together with arms, and resist
the officer of the law, or murder his assistants. His acts, his
declarations, and his conduct are fair subjects for your careful
examination, in order to judge of his intentions or his guilty
complicity with those whose hands perpetrated the offence. If
he came there without any knowledge of what was about to take
place, and took no part, by encouraging, countenancing or aiding
the perpetrators of the offence,&mdash;if he merely stood neutral,
through fear of bodily harm, or because he was conscientiously
scrupulous about assisting to arrest a fugitive from labor, and
therefore merely refused to interfere, while he did not aid or
encourage the offenders, he may not have acted the part of a
good citizen, he may be liable to punishment for such neutrality,
by fine and imprisonment, but he cannot be said to be liable as a
principal in the riot, murder and treason committed by the
others&mdash;and much more so if his only interference was to preserve
the lives of the officer and his assistants.&#8221;</p>

<p>If you should find that the defendant did <i>not</i> aid, abet or
assist in the perpetration of the offence, you will return a verdict
of not guilty, without regard to the grade of the offence, whether
riot, murder or treason.</p>

<p>But if you should find that he has so aided and abetted, so as
thereby to become a principal according to the rules of law, you
will next have to inquire whether the offence, as proved, amounts
to &#8220;Treason against the United States.&#8221;</p>

<p>This is defined by the Constitution itself. Congress has no
power to enlarge, restrain, construe, or define the offence. By
this instrument it is declared, &#8220;Treason against the U. S. shall
consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their
enemies, giving them aid and comfort.&#8221;</p>

<p>What constitutes &#8220;levying war against the Government&#8221; is a
question which has been a subject of much discussion.</p>

<p>&#8220;The term &#8216;levying war,&#8217;&#8221; says Chief Justice Marshall, &#8220;is
not for the first time applied to treason by the Constitution of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
the U. S. It is a technical term. It is used in a very old
statute of that country whose language is our language, and whose
laws form the substratum of our laws. It is scarcely conceivable
that the term was not employed by the framers of our Constitution,
in the sense which has been affixed to it by those from
whom we borrowed it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Since the adoption of the Constitution, but few cases of indictment
for treason have occurred, and most of those not many years
afterwards. Many of the English cases <i>then</i> considered good law
and quoted by the best text writers as authorities, have since
been discredited, if not overruled in that country. The better
opinion then seems to be, that the term &#8220;levying war,&#8221; should
be confined to insurrections and rebellions, for the purpose of
overturning the government by force and arms. Many of the
cases of constructive treason quoted by Foster, Hale, and other
writers, would perhaps now be treated merely as aggravated
riots or felonies.</p>

<p>But for the purposes of the present case, it is not necessary to
look beyond the cases decided in our own country.</p>

<p>After quoting several American authorities, he continued.
&#8220;The resistance to the execution of a law of the United States,
accompanied with any degree of force, if for a <i>private purpose</i>,
is not treason. To constitute that offence, the object of the resistance
must be of a public and general nature.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the application of these principles to the case before us, the
Jury will observe that the &#8220;levying of war&#8221; against the United
States is not necessarily to be judged of alone, by the number
or array of troops. But there must be a conspiracy to resist
by force, and an actual resistance by force of arms, or intimidation
by numbers. This conspiracy and the insurrection connected
with it, must be to effect something of a <i>public nature</i>, to
overthrow the government, or to nullify some law of the United
States, and totally to hinder its execution or compel its repeal.</p>

<p>Without desiring to invade the prerogatives of the Jury in
judging of the facts of this case, the Court feel bound to say that
they do not think the transaction with which the prisoner is
charged with being connected, rises to the dignity of treason, or
a levying of war. Not because the numbers or force was insufficient,
but</p>





<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>1st. For want of any proof of previous conspiracy to make a
<i>general</i> and <i>public resistance to any law</i> of the United States.</p>

<p>2d. There is no evidence that any person connected in the
transaction, knew there were such acts of Congress, as those
which they are charged with conspiring to resist by force and
arms, or had any other intention than to protect one another from
what they termed kidnappers.</p>

<p>The testimony of the <i>prosecution</i> shows that notice had been
given that certain fugitives were pursued; and that the riot, insurrection,
tumult, or whatever you may call it, was but a sudden
&#8220;conclamatio,&#8221; or running together to prevent the capture of
certain of their friends, or conspirators, or to rescue them if
arrested.</p>

<p>He concluded by some general remarks upon the enormity of
the offence committed against the State government, and the
part which had been taken in the whole transaction; by the
States of Maryland and Pennsylvania, and the General Government.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p>The Jury having heard the charge, retired to deliberate. They
returned in about <i>ten minutes</i>, and rendered a verdict of <small>NOT
GUILTY</small>.</p>

<p>After the verdict had been rendered and the Jury discharged,
the District Attorney said, that the prisoner was charged on four
other bills of indictment for misdemeanor. On these he proposed
to move for a <i>nolle prosequi</i>, and said that if the State of Pennsylvania
did not hold him to answer any other charges, he would
move for his discharge.</p>

<p>Judge Grier said that, on motion of the District Attorney, the
defendant was discharged, and Hanway left the Court room a
free man&mdash;after an imprisonment of four months wanting a day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
The next day, (Friday Dec. 12th,) after a long conversation,
Elijah Lewis and Samuel Williams were admitted to bail in the
sum of $2000 each, and several bills against some of the prisoners
were <i>nol pros&#8217;d</i>, on the motion of the District Attorney.</p>

<p>On the following Wednesday, (Dec. 17th,) the Court met
again for the purpose of taking some action in reference to the
remainder of the prisoners, who were charged with treason.
The District Attorney said that inasmuch as the charge of
Judge Grier to the jury in the case Hanway, clearly convinced
him that, upon the evidence, the charge of treason could not be
sustained, he had determined to enter a <i>nolle prosequi</i> upon the
remainder of the bills. He thought, however, that a clear case
of murder and riot had been made out, for which the prisoners
were amenable to the State authorities, and he had communicated
with the authorities at Lancaster upon the subject. In reply,
the District Attorney of Lancaster county had informed
him, that detainers had been lodged at the Moyamensing prison
by virtue of which they would be carried to Lancaster, by the
U. S. authorities. He therefore moved that the U. S. Marshal be
directed to remove the prisoners to Lancaster at his leisure, there
to await the action of a Grand and Petit Jury of that county.
Mr. Ashmead further said, that he would lodge detainers against
the prisoners with the authorities of Lancaster, in order that
they might be tried in the U. S. Courts in Philadelphia for misdemeanor,
should they by any possibility escape punishment in
Lancaster. He was determined to do his whole duty in the case,
and if these men were to go unpunished, it should not be through
neglect on his part.</p>

<p>The Court then made the order as required, and Judge Kane
discharged the jurors from further attendance.</p>

<p>Mr. Read then asked for an order from the Court for the payment
of the defendant&#8217;s witnesses, and cited the case of Aaron
Burr in support of the request. The District Attorney asked
that a time be fixed for argument upon the matter, and the
Court named Friday as the day on which they would consider
the motion. The argument was heard as appointed, and the
Court refused to make the order.</p>

<p>Those in authority had determined, as has been seen, to
abandon the prosecution for treason. To avoid the imputation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
of imbecility, it was resolved to attempt a conviction upon the
charge of misdemeanor under the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850.
So much noise had been made about the grade of crime committed
at Christiana, that it was not expedient to permit the
matter to leave the U. S. Courts after the verdict of &#8220;not guilty&#8221;
in Hanway&#8217;s case.</p>

<p>Accordingly, Samuel Williams was detained for trial in Philadelphia,
while his partners in crime were removed to Lancaster
to await the action of the State authorities. His principal
offence was not such as made him amenable to the State of Pennsylvania,
it not being charged that he was ever at Parker&#8217;s
house.</p>

<p>Sufficient breathing time having elapsed after the trial of
Hanway, William&#8217;s case was called on Monday, January 5,
1852, in the District Court, before Judge Kane. All parties
not being ready for trial, a postponement of one week was
ordered.</p>

<p>On Monday, the 12th of January, the prisoner was arraigned
on two bills, one charging him with interfering to prevent the
arrest of Noah Buley, the other with interfering to prevent
the arrest of Joshua Hammond. To both of these charges he
plead not guilty.</p>

<p>On the part of the prosecution G. L. Ashmead, Esq., James R.
Ludlow, Esq., and John W. Ashmead, U. S. District Attorney,
appeared; and R. P. Kane, Esq., W. S. Pierce, Esq., and D. P.
Brown, Esq., appeared in behalf of the defendant.</p>

<p>After some delay the following jury was empannelled: Pratt
Roberts, Chester Co.; Thomas Vaughn, Philadelphia County;
Henry McMahen, Philadelphia city; Patrick McBride, Philadelphia
Co.; Michael Keenan, do.; Frederick Boley, Sr., do.;
Joseph Dowden, Chester Co.; Samuel Culp, Germantown;
Minshall Painter, Delaware Co.; Joseph Thornton, Philadelphia
Co.; Francis Parke, Chester Co.; and Peter M&#8217;Conomy,
Lancaster.</p>

<p>Mr. G. L. Ashmead opened the case to the jury by stating
what evidence would be presented to them, and his view of the
law of the case. In this, as in the trial for treason, Kline was
the principal witness against the defendant, and the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
of the evidence offered was a repetition of that in Hanway&#8217;s
case.</p>

<p>After several postponements on account of the illness of the
presiding Judge, the case was resumed on Monday, February 2d.
The defence relied upon, was the deficiencies in the evidence
for the Government, and the uniform good character of the defendant.
After able argument, the case was given to the jury
on Wednesday, February 4th. On Thursday they returned a
verdict of &#8220;<i>not guilty</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the meantime the State authorities had been proceeding
in the matter. On Monday Jan. 12, 1852, the Lancaster County
Court of Oyer and Terminer and Quarter Sessions, met at Lancaster
city. On Thursday the 15th, the District Attorney of
Lancaster sent up to the Grand Jury a number of bills charging
Castner Hanway, E. Lewis, J. Scarlett, and the other defendants
in the treason cases, (some of whom were in prison, not having
been able to procure the bail required,) with riot and the murder
of Edward Gorsuch. The next day, about one P. M. the
bills were returned to Court, all <small>IGNORED</small>. That afternoon those
&#8220;Traitors&#8221; in prison were released, and the bonds of those on
bail were cancelled.</p>

<p>Thus ended the prosecutions growing out of the Christiana
riot. The great mistake made in the whole proceeding, from first
to last, was, that those men who might perhaps have been indicted
with some show of justice, for riot, though not for treason,
<i>were never arrested</i>. The outrage was committed on the
11th of September, before five o&#8217;clock A. M. The oath of
Kline before Joseph D. Pownall, upon which the warrants were
issued for the arrest of the guilty parties, was not made until
more than twenty-eight hours afterwards. From that time the
most unrelenting vigilance was observed, and the neighborhood
virtually placed under martial law. But measures were taken
too late. Only those men remained within the reach of tardy
justice who <i>felt</i> and <i>knew</i> they were guilty of no crime. The
rest preferred flight to dangerous delay.</p>

<p>When time and opportunity permit, guilty men <i>will</i> avoid the
penalty imposed by law, whether the crime be treason, murder,
riot or larceny; and active, energetic officers usually pursue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
before the modern facilities for travelling have carried a criminal
beyond their reach.</p>

<p>Those in authority are often compelled to rely upon the representations
of their subordinates, and in this case the rumors
which at first started the public and the braggadocio telegraphic
dispatches, <i>probably</i> led the higher officers of justice to suppose
that the guilty had been secured. The array of soldiery, the
special police force detailed from Philadelphia, and the levy of
extemporaneous troops from the neighborhood, <i>certainly</i> induced
the uninitiated public to believe that the net had been properly
cast. But when drawn ashore it was found to contain a few
persons who had been led to the scene of action from the best
and most philanthropic motives, some of whom, instead of &#8220;levying
war against their native country,&#8221; or &#8220;aiding and abetting in
the murder of Edward Gorsuch,&#8221; had bravely interposed between
the infuriated blacks and their assailants, and by their conduct
saved the lives of the remaining companions of this unfortunate
stranger;&mdash;men who, instead of a felon&#8217;s cell, shattered health,
and the total wreck of their worldly prospects, merited the thanks
of all who would spare the shedding of innocent blood.</p>

<p>Before the first flourish of the first trumpets had died away,
those whose positions afterwards required them to conduct the
prosecutions had gone too far to retract. The false and distorted
statements which had found their way into the public prints,
before the real truth had been ascertained, were republished and
believed throughout the country; and the Quixottic expedition of
U. S. troops and their impromptu associates in Lancaster
county were thought by many, as well in the State of Pennsylvania
as at a distance, to have been undertaken against a dangerous
and resolute host of genuine traitors. The affair happening
upon the eve of a popular election in our own State, and at a
time when the &#8220;fire eating&#8221; party in the South was exerting
its utmost to disseminate discord and dissatisfaction, furnished
ambitious and unprincipled men with fuel for the flames they
were striving to kindle. What wonder then if the timid and
uninformed at first foresaw in this first alarm a conflagration
that was to devastate the whole country?</p>

<p>To allay public excitement it was necessary to prove <i>publicly</i>
that these exaggerated reports of traitorous combinations were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
merely the result of vain boasting and a desire for notoriety on
the part of a few silly men, who had not wit enough to foresee
the lamentable consequences of abusing the authority with which
they had been imprudently entrusted. Whether the course pursued
to gain this end was the most judicious, is somewhat questionable,
though it seems to have been sanctioned by the very <i>highest</i>
authority in the country. The parties implicated by the miserable
management of those who took the initiative measures, had
rights, and, though the prerogatives of office gave the <i>power</i>, it
is doubtful whether a due regard to the public welfare justified
the Federal authorities in imprisoning for months innocent men,
subjecting them and their friends to the inconvenience and expense
of such investigations.</p>

<p>To prove to the nation that its bungling agents had arrested
the wrong men, cost the Government nearly Fifty Thousand
Dollars. It excited between the authorities of neighboring States
bitter animosities and unjust recriminations, where before had existed
the best feeling and undisturbed harmony. It, for a time
at least, inflamed sectional prejudices and caused renewed agitation
of a question whose difficulties the greatest men of the nation
had for years been striving to adjust peaceably. It cost the
parties who were to be subjected to this ordeal, their liberty for
months, the total abandonment, and, in some cases, the utter
ruin of their business; to a few the loss of health, to all the entire
privation, until the trial, of those comforts and sources of enjoyment
upon which we are all so much dependent for happiness,
and an expenditure of money in preparing for their defence
that some were totally unable to meet, and that robbed a few of
the entire earnings of industry and frugality. It cost their families
many bitter tears and hours of anguish, depriving them for
a protracted and severe winter of their natural protectors, upon
whose exertions many of them were dependant for daily sustenance.</p>

<p>To compensate for this enormous public and private expenditure
of money&mdash;for the fearful, but, to public sympathy, the disregarded
days of agony which took the place of happy and peaceful
hours&mdash;and for this useless agitation throughout the nation,

any individual, save to a few of those who were engaged professionally
in these cases.</p>

<p>There rests somewhere a fearful responsibility. This ill-timed
attempt to punish with public hatred and infamy, or with fine
and imprisonment, perhaps death, the innocent instead of the
guilty, was the result either of a pitiable desire for unenviable
notoriety, or of a culpable and unpardonable negligence on the
part of those who were the sources of the movement. For either
cause, no excuse can be offered before any tribunal.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
